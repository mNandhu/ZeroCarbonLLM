Over the last decade, CO 2 adsorption technology has quickly gained popularity and is now widely applied
in global CCUS projects due to playing an important role in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. As a
result, novel materials, or post-modi ﬁ cation methods of those already available have been successively
reported to enhance the ef ﬁ ciency of CO 2 capture from ﬂ ue gases. This paper discusses a systematic
understanding of fundamental aspects of current research trends in terms of developing selected solid
CO 2 adsorbent, with a particular emphasis on the upcoming challenges. The candidates are reviewed
considering the practical drawbacks of imposed by industrial scale and economics, including carbon-
based materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), polymers, zeolites, silica, alumina, metal oxides,
amine-based adsorbents, and other composite porous materials. Sustainable sorbents derived from
biomass and industrial residues are also studied due to the high need for cost-effective raw materials and
their crucial role in the circular economy. Lastly, a techno-economic analysis (TEA) is included to provide
the most important criteria that should be considered when adsorbents are implemented on an in-
dustrial scale. Consequently, the review is summarized, and recommendations are offered for future
research in the advancement of CO 2 capture materials. The paper aims to establish a comprehensive
theoretical basis of adsorption technologies currently progressed to reduce CO 2 emissions, along with
highlighting the identi ﬁ cation and precise articulation of the most important future research paths that
could be bene ﬁ cial to address over the next years.

##### Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, there has been
##### an exceptional boost in the amount of heavy pollution released
##### from industrial facilities, mainly as a result of the burning of fossil
##### fuels (coal, crude oil, and natural gas). Today, one of the most
##### challenging and urgent environmental issues facing the world is
##### the reduction of CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere, which is
##### widely reported to be the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas that
##### leads to global warming and climate changes [ 1 ]. For this reason,

##### the constant rise in average temperatures throughout the world
##### and the associated frequency with greater intensity of the emer-
##### gence of severe extreme weather events (heat waves, droughts,
##### blizzards, and rainstorms) are among the most direct and imme-
##### diately apparent effects that have resulted from this phenomenon
##### [ 2 , 3 ]. It is anticipated that human activities have contributed to an
##### escalation of global temperature of around 1   C surpassing those of
##### the pre-industrial period of time, with a probable range of
##### 0.8 e 1.2   C [ 4 ]. In 2020, CO 2 average annual level in the atmosphere
##### was approximately 50% higher than in the 60's 18th century and
##### has attained their greatest value recorded in the history of
##### 412.5 ppm [ 5 ].
##### Unfortunately, the rapid development of the world's economic,
##### and accelerating industrialization, with a soaring world population,
##### will de ﬁ nitely cause a gradual growth of CO 2 emissions and will
##### affect global warming to reach 1.5   C in the next 30 years at the
##### current state [ 1 ]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on
##### Climate Change (IPCC) latest report from 2022, to prevent this

##### scenario, climate change mitigation efforts should be executed
##### immediately. IPCC estimation indicates that the peak of GHG
##### emissions must take place in 2025 at the latest, so by 2030 a 43%
##### reduction of it will possibly be achieved. Otherwise, by the end of
##### 2100 the average temperature on Earth and atmospheric concen-
##### tration of CO 2 will increase by 3.2   C and to 570 ppm, respectively
##### [ 6 ]. In order to prevent this occurrence and meet the Paris Agree-
##### ment climate ambition, speci ﬁ c system changes for energy man-
##### agement ##### should ##### be ##### adopted. ##### In ##### particular, ##### innovative
##### transformation concerns industry, which is responsible for 25% of
##### CO 2 emissions from energy and industrial processes, such as the
##### cement, chemicals, iron and steel sectors [ 7 ]. Furthermore, it is
##### associated with widespread electri ﬁ cation, better energy ef ﬁ ciency,
##### aiming at rational supervision of fossil fuel exploitation, and
##### intensi ﬁ cation of the share of renewable energy sources (hydrogen,
##### biomass-based fuels, solar energy, or nuclear power) in global en-
##### ergy consumption. Although the above long-term plans have
##### enormous potential, they are currently unable to lessen the carbon
##### footprint of humanity simply by mitigation of CO 2 emissions,
##### burning fossil fuels, and R & D on total commercialization of clean
##### energy requires large ﬁ nancial outlays and investments, and above
##### all time.
##### In view of this, over the course of the last several decades, a
##### concerted initiative has been launched all over the world to create
##### new methods for point source carbon capture aiming to stop CO 2
##### emissions from entering the atmosphere. Especially one receives
##### the most interest and is predicted to play a crucial part in the
##### evolution toward the use of low-carbon energy, which is called
##### carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). The CCUS system
##### speci ﬁ es a group of technologies, such as carbon capture and
##### storage (CCS), carbon capture and utilization (CCU), or bioenergy
##### with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Among the CCUS value
##### chain, the CO 2 capture stage roughly represented around 70 e 90% of
##### total operating expenditures, making it one of the key research
##### areas for maturing the entire technologies and contributing to the
##### achievement of net zero emissions [ 8 ]. Depending on the speci ﬁ c
##### CO 2 manufacturing method, operating conditions, composition of
##### ﬂ ue gas and process parameters, there are three main capture ap-
##### proaches: pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture, and
##### oxy-fuel combustion [ 9 ]. Each of the above uses various CO 2 sep-
##### aration process, which are the most vital part of CO 2 capture,
##### including: absorption, membranes, cryogenic method, chemical
##### looping combustion (CLC), calcium looping (CaL), and adsorption.

##### 1.2. A wide spectrum of CO 2 capture materials

##### contains speci ﬁ c materials that are commonly called physical and
##### chemical adsorbents.
##### Generally, the most widely used solid materials for CO 2 capture
##### are silica, zeolites, alumina, amine-based materials, metal oxides,
##### metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), polymers, and carbon materials
##### (activated carbon, graphite, graphene, fullerene, carbon nanotubes,
##### biochar, and hydrochar). Moreover, it is crucial to elucidate the
##### differentiation between amorphous and crystalline solids in terms
##### of sorbents due to their substantial impact on CO 2 uptake perfor-
##### mance, related strictly with their distinct physical and chemical
##### characteristics. Crystalline materials exhibit distinct pore structures
##### and surface areas, thus demonstrating the potential for signi ﬁ cant
##### CO 2 adsorption capacity. Their high stability under harsh process
##### conditions and precise regulation of pore size and distribution can
##### be optimized for practical purposes in CCUS projects. In contrast,
##### materials characterized by the absence of a de ﬁ nite lattice pattern
##### in the arrangement of its constituent atoms and molecules
##### demonstrate an amorphous structure. The lack of a de ﬁ ned
##### arrangement often results in elevated surface areas and porosities,
##### making them highly suitable for CO 2 capture. However, it could also
##### potentially lead to inadequate stability and diminished selectivity.
##### Therefore, it is imperative to understand the properties while
##### choosing and formulating CO 2 capture materials for particular uses.
##### The optimal CO 2 adsorption ef ﬁ ciency can be achieved by utilizing
##### either amorphous or crystalline materials, or a combination of both,
##### depending on the speci ﬁ c requirements of the application. The
##### number of publications since 2013 that have concerned solid ma-
##### terials for CO 2 capture is shown in Fig. 1 .
##### As can be observed, over the last several years, there has been a
##### substantial increase in the number of researchers interested in CO 2
##### capture by adsorption. This results directly in the publication of
##### scienti ﬁ c articles related to the synthesis of different new materials
##### or post-modi ﬁ cation methods to optimize the ef ﬁ ciency of the CO 2
##### adsorption capacity. However, a generic overview that focuses on
##### summarizing the current knowledge for beginner scientist in this
##### ﬁ eld in sense of critical limitations, opportunities, or research trend
##### for a speci ﬁ c adsorbent group, is not something that has been re-
##### ported very often in the recent years.
##### In general, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive
##### summary of advances that have been accomplished in in the
##### development of solid CO 2 capture materials with highly insightful
##### current and future research directions. Furthermore, our work in-
##### cludes a compilation of up-to-date data on physicochemical mea-
##### surements along with modi ﬁ cation strategies to improve CO 2
##### adsorption capacity. Moreover, we also discuss the details of the
##### techno-economic analysis (TEA), which is an essential procedure
##### for introducing novel materials on an industrial level. Ultimately,
##### several concluding perspectives are provided with proposed solu-
##### tions for the existing challenges and upcoming barriers in com-
##### mercial facilitation of discussed sorbents.

##### 2. Desired properties and criteria for selecting CO 2 capture
##### materials

##### The application of solid adsorbent materials is widely regarded
##### as one of the most promising research directions and has garnered
##### a high amount of attention for carbon capture in CCUS [ 10 ]. It de-
##### livers bene ﬁ ts such as, amongst others: considerably high CO 2
##### uptake ef ﬁ ciency, easy regeneration, simple handling, wide process
##### operability range, material stability, the possibility of using broadly
##### understood waste to produce materials [ 11 ]. Important de ﬁ nitions
##### that should be used for the correct CO 2 adsorption characteristics
##### are the formulations of the individuals participating in the process:
##### adsorbent e a solid on which gas molecules from inside the gas
##### phase are adsorbed, and adsorbate e a gas that has ﬁ nally been
##### adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent [ 12 ]. There are two main
##### types of gas molecule adsorption on the surface of a solid. If the
##### accumulation of the adsorbate on the surface of the solid occurs
##### due to weak intermolecular van der Waals interactions, then
##### adsorption is termed physisorption or physical adsorption [ 12 , 13 ].
##### When gas molecules accumulate on the surface of the adsorbent by
##### chemical bonds, the phenomenon occurring is called chemical
##### adsorption or chemisorption [ 14 ]. Each of these two groups

##### To ef ﬁ ciently removing CO 2 from the ﬂ ue gas mixture, the
##### synthesized adsorbents should possess stringently speci ﬁ ed good
##### characteristics and satisfy technical and economic requirements
##### that are favorable for CO 2 adsorption ( Fig. 2 ). First and foremost, the
##### material must be characterized by a high capacity to ef ﬁ ciently
##### adsorb CO 2 under a variety of process conditions. Additionally, it is
##### essential that the materials have superior application capability for
##### commercial purposes. Regrettably, it is quite unusual to satisfy all
##### crucial requirements. In this section, an evaluation of the most
##### important adsorbent properties and criteria are listed below
##### [ 12 , 14 ].

Fig. 2. The most important properties and criteria for selecting CO 2 capture materials.

#####  Equilibrium adsorption capacity is directly related to the speci ﬁ c
##### surface, pore size, and surface chemistry of the adsorbent. The
##### capacity value indicates the maximum amount of adsorbate
##### related to the adsorbent mass unit that can be adsorbed at
##### equilibrium (phase equilibrium at the solid e gas interface,
##### where the adsorption rate is equal to the desorption rate) for a
##### given temperature and pressure.
#####  CO 2 selectivity parameter serves as a theoretical metric for
##### evaluating the practical effectiveness of an adsorbent, especially
##### in scenarios involving the adsorption of multicomponent
##### gaseous mixtures. It mainly depends on the size, shape, and
##### distribution of pore network. The selectivity has a direct impact
##### on the degree of purity of the obtained product, which in turn
##### affects the economics of the adsorption installation. This crite-
##### rion is the most important for physical adsorbents.
#####  Kinetics of adsorption and desorption are in ﬂ uenced by several
##### factors, including the size of adsorbate molecules, the porosity
##### of sorbent material, the concentration of adsorbate in the ﬂ ue
##### gas stream, and even the type of chemical bonding formed
##### during the process, which also exerts a signi ﬁ cant impact. Ki-
##### netics during CO 2 sorption should exhibit favorable and signif-
##### icantly fast behaviour, indicating that a short time is required to
##### attain the equilibrium state between the adsorbate e adsorbent
##### complex or to facilitate expedited regeneration of the adsor-
##### bent bed.

#####  Mechanical properties, the adsorbent should be mechanically
##### strong, i.e., perfectly resistant to abrasion and crushing during
##### its operation in process equipment (adsorption and chromato-
##### graphic columns under various process conditions). These
##### properties directly affect the ef ﬁ ciency of the process and the
##### generation of additional costs.
#####  Chemical nature of surface is also an important determinant.
##### The adsorption capacity of adsorbent may be enhanced by the
##### presence of heteroatomic functional groups in the form of
##### carbon e oxygen, carbon e nitrogen, or carbon e sulfur on its sur-
##### face. The most signi ﬁ cant functional groups contain oxygen
##### atoms, so conferring a hydrophilic (polar) character to the outer
##### surface, in addition to the hydrophobic (nonpolar) nature shown
##### by the internal structure of the material. The dual nature of the
##### adsorbent surface allows it to effectively adsorb a diverse range
##### of gases, with a particular emphasis on CO 2 from ﬂ ue gas
##### streams containing moisture.
#####  Pores characteristics, there is a one-to-one correlation between
##### the presence of micropores and the effectiveness of material in
##### the adsorption process. Their widths are comparable to those of
##### the CO 2 molecules that are capable of being adsorbed, falling
##### within the range of &lt; 2 nm. Mesopores and macropores, which
##### serve secondary functions, have the responsibility of trans-
##### porting the adsorbed gaseous medium via a network of
##### channels.

#####  Chemical and thermal stability, adsorbents are often exposed to
##### harsh chemical conditions (the ﬂ ue gas stream mainly contains
##### water vapor and other impurities, such as CO, trace elements,
##### particulates, NO x , and SO x ), as well as high pressure and
##### elevated ##### temperature. ##### Robust ##### stability ##### and ##### exceptional
##### tolerance under these conditions ensure their proper lifetime,
##### high equilibrium sorption capacity, and the possibility of
##### subsequent regeneration and reuse in a greater number of
##### adsorption e desorption cycles. The lack of an appropriate degree
##### of chemical and thermal stability of the sorbent directly affects
##### the economics of the entire CO 2 separation process.
#####  Regeneration capacity, adsorbents undergo a regeneration pro-
##### cess after their adsorption capacity is exhausted, as a result of
##### the maximum ﬁ lling of the pore volume and occupying their
##### surface with CO 2 molecules. The process of regeneration in-
##### volves removal of the adsorbed CO 2 molecules from both the
##### pores and the surface of adsorbent by desorption. This fully al-
##### lows the restoration of the sorption capabilities of the material.
##### Furthermore, the investigation of optimal sorbent regeneration
##### conditions is now a key subject of current research in the se-
##### lection of the suitable materials. Depending on their structure
##### and physicochemical properties, the adsorption/desorption cy-
##### cles are carried out considering parameters, such as tempera-
##### ture, pressure, and applying a speci ﬁ c adsorption technology or
##### as a combination of several types: pressure swing adsorption
##### (PSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), vacuum pressure swing
##### adsorption (VPSA), temperature swing adsorption (TSA), tem-
##### perature pressure swing adsorption (TPSA), and electric swing
##### adsorption (ESA).
#####  Stability in adsorption/desorption cycles and the lifetime of
##### adsorbents play a crucial role in determining the frequency of
##### material replacement, hence directly in ﬂ uencing the economic
##### viability of industrial-scale installations.
#####  Production costs are another crucial parameter that is consid-
##### ered obligatorily in terms of the development of adsorbent
##### production technology and the analysis of prospective research
##### directions for materials suited to CO 2 sorption processes.
#####  Environmental implications, it is essential to appropriately
##### dispose of adsorbents that are incapable of undergoing further
##### regeneration. Therefore, they cannot possess a signi ﬁ cant
##### adverse in ﬂ uence on the environment.

##### [ 19 ]. Additional complications encompass equipment corrosion
##### and amine solvent degradation due to the presence of oxygen in the
##### aqueous solution [ 20 ]. Therefore, to minimize these issues and
##### potential elevated costs, research efforts are concentrated on the
##### development of amine-functionalized solid materials, referred to as
##### N-functionalized solid adsorbents (NFSAs). This approach aims to
##### improve the CO 2 capture capacity of amine groups by increasing
##### functional group availability and adsorption kinetics, concurrently
##### ensuring stability and high porosity. Moreover, when compared to
##### unmodi ﬁ ed porous adsorbents, NFSAs exhibit improved CO 2 af-
##### ﬁ nity and superior moisture tolerance. Thus, they have garnered
##### attention as highly promising candidates for CO 2 adsorption from
##### ﬂ ue gas mixtures [ 21 , 22 ]. The excellent af ﬁ nity of N-functionalized
##### solid adsorbents towards CO 2 and their enhanced resistance to
##### moisture can be attributed to the existence of nitrogen-containing
##### functional groups on their surface. These functional groups possess
##### the capability to interact with CO 2 molecules via diverse mecha-
##### nisms such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and
##### Lewis acid-base interactions. Furthermore, the nitrogen-containing
##### functional groups confer hydrophobic characteristics to NFSAs,
##### enabling them to withstand moisture and maintain CO 2 uptake
##### ef ﬁ ciency even in high-humidity conditions.
##### The amine-based adsorbents are typically synthesized in two
##### independent steps: initial preparation of solid supports and the
##### subsequent integration of N-source sorbents with these supports.
##### For the creation of high-performance NFSAs, a variety of different
##### amine types can be employed, as listed in Table 1 .
##### Further, numerous porous solid materials have also been
##### investigated and documented for their ability to adsorb CO 2 from
##### ﬂ ue gas streams. These materials involve the functionalization of
##### amines onto supports like activated carbons (ACs), carbon-based
##### nanoadsorbents, mesoporous silica, zeolites, porous organic poly-
##### mers, metal oxides, and others, all of which are extensively covered
##### in this review. To date, three distinct classes of amine-based sor-
##### bent have been identi ﬁ ed, based on the combination of the amine
##### species/support material (bond structures), and nitrogen sources
##### (types of amines) [ 23 , 24 ].
##### These classes are categorized as follows: Class 1 (impregnation
##### method), Class 2 (grafting method), and a combination of the
##### impregnation and grafting approaches, often referred to as Class 3
##### (direct synthesis method) [ 25 , 26 ]. Each of these classes offers
##### unique synthesis paths, which are described below:

##### The evaluation of the described criteria and attributes of ad-
##### sorbent's effectiveness to capture CO 2 is based on an analysis of the
##### initial characteristics of synthesized materials, as well as experi-
##### mental investigations into CO 2 adsorption isotherms, breakthrough
##### curves of adsorbent bed, and mass transport kinetics. The entire
##### procedure is shown schematically Fig. 3 .

##### 3. CO 2 capture materials

##### 3.1. Amine-based adsorbents

##### One prevalent method used in the industrial sector so far in-
##### volves the utilization of aqueous amine solutions with a concen-
##### tration ranging from 20 to 30 wt% for the purpose of capturing post-
##### combustion carbon dioxide [ 15 e 17 ]. This approach is primarily
##### favored owing to the notable af ﬁ nity shown by amines towards
##### CO 2 . Nevertheless, the practicality of using amine is limited due to
##### many drawbacks. One of these disadvantages is the high heat ca-
##### pacity of the liquid phase, which results in substantial energy
##### consumption and increased costs during the regeneration process
##### [ 18 ]. Another signi ﬁ cant dif ﬁ culty connected with aqueous amine
##### absorption lies in its limited technological scalability, con ﬁ ning its
##### applicability to CO 2 capture from coal or natural gas power plants

#####  Class I materials are prepared through the physically loading
##### monomeric or polymeric amine species, amino acid, amino-
##### containing ionic liquid, into accessible pores and on the sur-
##### face of porous support [ 27 , 28 ]. This process involves the use of a
##### solvent, typically water or organic solvents like methanol or
##### ethanol, to combine the amine with the support. The solvent
##### aids in dispersing amine molecules into the pores of the support
##### material [ 27 ]. Within the pores and on the support surface,
##### amine molecules that have formed bonds with each other serve
##### as active adsorption sites for capturing CO 2 . Notably, the amine
##### groups do not interact with the support in a chemical manner,
##### meaning there is no substantial chemical bond or reaction be-
##### tween the loaded amines and the surface of the support. The
##### total pore volume of the porous material, along with the amine
##### density, plays a key role in determining the amount of amine
##### that can be effectively dispersed into the porous structure [ 29 ].
##### Ideally, the support material should possess a larger pore vol-
##### ume, as this increases the potential capacity for impregnated
##### amine. Once the impregnation step is complete, excess solvent is
##### removed through ﬁ ltration, followed by drying of the solution.
##### The resulting amine-loaded adsorbent is then further dried in an
##### oven at a temperature of around 40   C [ 30 ].

##### presence of C e O interface bonds [ 31 ]. Compared to the
##### impregnation and grafting methods, the direct synthesis
##### process ##### is ##### accomplished ##### in ##### a ##### single ##### step, ##### reducing ##### the
##### complexity of the operation. Furthermore, the distribution of
##### amino groups in the amine-based solid adsorbent is more
##### uniform compared to the other methods [ 29 ]. This class of
##### supported materials can be considered as a cross-over be-
##### tween the other two methods.

#####  In class II, materials are synthesized by dissolving the amine-
##### containing organosilanes in a volatile solvent. The adsorbent is
##### introduced into the solution and heated to facilitate covalent
##### tethering. During this covalent bonding process, the amines of
##### the silane group become attached to the surface functional
##### groups of the support material. More speci ﬁ cally, hydroxyl
##### groups (OH e ) at the target interface form bonds with the central
##### region of the organosilanes, leading to adhesion [ 31 , 32 ].
##### Therefore, it's crucial that the support material's surface con-
##### tains a high concentration of these hydroxyl functional groups.
##### Once the grafting process is complete, the primary solvent is
##### replaced with a second volatile solvent. This step serves to
##### activate the adsorbent by removing any remaining unreacted
##### amine molecules [ 31 , 33 ]. Consequently, the number of active
##### groups present on the substrate surface is critical in determining
##### the quantity of loaded amine and the resulting adsorption per-
##### formance [ 34 ]. This synthesis approach results in a stronger
##### linkage between the support and the amine compared to the
##### impregnation method.
#####  Class III materials are created through in situ polymerizations
##### of the amine-containing precursor, which is the amine poly-
##### mer monomer in the porous material. The direct synthesis
##### method also relies on chemical bonding, resulting in materials
##### featuring a single covalent bond for each amine molecule.
##### Additionally, ##### these ##### materials ##### are ##### characterized ##### by ##### the

##### Considering the three major techniques mentioned above. Two
##### different types of adsorbents can be synthesized, such as amine-
##### loaded adsorbents (obtained by impregnation and grafting) and
##### N-doped adsorbents (prepared by direct synthesis). In addition, a
##### novel synthesis approach called double functionalization has been
##### developed for the preparation of amine-based materials. This
##### approach involves two functionalization steps, namely impregna-
##### tion and grafting, combining the bene ﬁ ts of these two single syn-
##### thesis techniques.
##### In conjunction with the numerous successes in the creation of
##### NFSAs for increased CO 2 capture in recent years, several reviews
##### have been compiled to provide the most up-to-date and relevant
##### insights into their development. Therefore, the focus is particu-
##### larly on review papers reported in 2020 e 2022. In 2020, Hu et al.
##### [ 27 ] published a review that explored future research and devel-
##### opment directions, as well as potential commercialization routes

##### for amine-based adsorbents. The researchers emphasized two
##### probable aspects of NFSAs development. The ﬁ rst objective is to
##### overcome their disadvantages, making them more competitive
##### with aqueous amines. The second objective is to investigate their
##### practical applications, including the design of test equipment and
##### technological methods applicable to current power plant systems
##### and cost reduction. For amine-loaded adsorbents, one inherent
##### drawback is their limited range of uses due to reduced adsorption
##### capacity caused by factors, including as ammonia loss during
##### extended adsorption operations, oxidative degradation of amines,
##### and degradation of porous supports due to irreversible adsorption
##### of ﬂ ue gas impurities like SO 2 , NO 2 , and O 2 . Regarding N-doped
##### adsorbents, a fundamental challenge is controlling their adsorp-
##### tion capacity, either through the selection of materials or by
##### improving the synthesis process. MOFs and polymers have been
##### highlighted as the most promising options for the future. In
##### conclusion, the authors point out the most important strategies
##### for enhancing the adsorption performances of amine-loaded ad-
##### sorbents, such as the following:

##### velopments in the production and assessment of different kinds of
##### amine functionalized materials, with the goal of presenting a
##### thorough overview of current work and future trends in materials
##### research and process implementation. The authors concluded that
##### to adequately evaluate the potential of amine-based adsorbents for
##### CO 2 capture, a comprehensive view must be employed, considering
##### a variety of measurements that take both material and process
##### performance into account. These data should be optimized as much
##### as possible and can be categorized into main utilization criteria,

##### amines often exhibit superior performance).

##### requirements, cost, long-term stability, and formulation. In terms of
##### future research, recent years have seen the development of class I-II
##### and class I-III hybridized amine-materials. These hybrids have
##### demonstrated superior working capability and cycle stability
##### compared to their individual class counterparts. In consequence, it
##### is highly likely that further advancements will be made in the

##### directed towards conducting TEA. This analysis is essential for
##### determining the costs associated with scaling up and ensuring the
##### stability of amine-based adsorbents on an industrial scale. Over the
##### years, various types of amines and adsorbent supports have been
##### extensively investigated. In the future, the primary focus of
##### research will be on identifying the optimal amine-adsorbent
##### combination. This blend should be easy to synthesize and seam-
##### lessly integrate into process operations with minimal loss of CO 2
##### capture capacity.
##### Recently, in 2021, Zhao et al. [ 29 ] conducted a comprehensive
##### review of the latest advancements in amine-functionalized solid
##### adsorbents for post-combustion capture. Their recommendations
##### for the development of NFSAs align with those proposed by Hu
##### et al. [ 27 ] and Gelles et al. [ 31 ]. The authors highlighted the need
##### to reduce preparatory costs and simplify the synthesis process,
##### aiming to design a highly ef ﬁ cient and eco-friendly production
##### method. They also stressed the importance of ﬁ nding effective
##### methods for introducing amines into practical support structures.
##### Hence, the review noted that certain impurity gases, such as
##### water vapor, can enhance CO 2 capture. Furthermore, most of the
##### amine-based adsorbents studied so far exist in powder form,
##### which can lead to challenges related to heat and mass transfer
##### during CO 2 adsorption. Consequently, there is growing interest in
##### monolithic adsorbents, which can improve heat and mass transfer
##### rates and eliminate the need for the molding process. Finally, the
##### review also mentioned the pressing need for research into the
##### stability of these adsorbents on the commercial scale. Addition-
##### ally, it's worth noting that amines are commonly employed as a
##### post-modi ﬁ cation method for solid CO 2 adsorbents, which are
##### treated as supports. This category includes materials like gra-
##### phene, graphite, activated carbons, and metal-organic frame-
##### works. Among these materials, silica stands out as it represents
##### the dominant research direction for amine functionalization
##### [ 80 , 87 ]. Therefore, this review begins by focusing on this type of
##### CO 2 capture materials.

##### Fig. 4 illustrates the modi ﬁ cation strategies, challenges, and
##### current research directions of amine-based adsorbents. The size
##### and color of the block sets change along the specialized investiga-
##### tion path, indicating that more speci ﬁ c areas of research are smaller
##### in size compared to those representing broader ones. The order is
##### consistently maintained: green &gt; blue &gt; purple &gt; crimson. The
##### same principle has been applied to other CO 2 capture materials as
##### well.

##### related to pore control, problematic functionalization, and inef-
##### fective binding of CO 2 molecules.
##### A signi ﬁ cant breakthrough in utilizing silica for sorption pur-
##### poses occurred in the 1990s, marking a crucial moment in materials
##### chemistry. Yanagisawa et al. [ 35 , 36 ] successfully synthesized mes-
##### oporous silica based on layered kanemite, which is a hydrated so-
##### dium silicate with the chemical formula NaHSi 2 O 5 $ 3H 2 O. This
##### speci ﬁ c silicate showed a high ion exchange capacity, and its
##### interlayer space was easily modi ﬁ able. The key innovation lay in the
##### introduction of surface-active cationic organic compounds, often
##### referred to as surfactants, between the layers of kanemite. This
##### process enabled the creation of porous silica with remarkable
##### characteristics, including a highly regular structure featuring a
##### hexagonally ordered pore system. Moreover, this material boasted
##### an exceptionally large speci ﬁ c surface area, reaching up to 900 m 2 /
##### g, and pores with an average size of about 3 nm.
##### In 1992, the Mobile Research and Development Corporation
##### achieved a notable advancement in creating materials similar to
##### those developed by Japanese scientists [ 37 , 38 ]. This material family
##### was named the M41S and comprised MCM-type materials (Mobil
##### Composition of Matter), which were classi ﬁ ed as MCM-41 (hex-
##### agonal), MCM-48 (cubic), and MCM-50 (lamellar, with surfactant
##### molecules present between the lamellae). They showed variations
##### in pore ordering. Especially, MCM-41 possesses a unidirectional
##### pore system, featuring a regularly arranged hexagonal array of
##### tubes. On the other hand, MCM-48 exhibits a three-dimensional
##### pore system characterized by two non-intersecting gyroid pores.
##### Among these, MCM-41 garnered the most attention due to its or-
##### dered and periodically repeating structure, even though it had an
##### amorphous wall structure [ 39 ]. It was further distinguished by a
##### speci ﬁ c surface area exceeding 1000 m 2 /g and relatively large pore
##### sizes, some of which reached up to 10 nm. The development of
##### M41S materials paved the way for the creation of new ordered
##### mesoporous silicas, including SBA (Santa Barbara Amorphous) [ 40 ],
##### MSU (Michigan State University), HMS (Hexagonal Mesoporous
##### Silica), KIL (Kemijski Institut Ljubljana), FSM (Folded Sheet Mate-
##### rials), FDU (Fudan University), and KIT (Korean Advanced Institute
##### of Science and Technology). These materials mainly differed in the
##### arrangement of mesopores [ 41 ]. Fig. 5 summarizes the collective
##### efforts made in developing silica materials over the past few years,
##### with their primary textural properties are presented in Table 2 .
##### The unique properties of ordered mesoporous silica materials
##### have broadened potential applications as solid sorbents for CO 2
##### capture in various scienti ﬁ c and technological disciplines. They
##### offer several advantages, including high adsorption capacity under
##### dry, high-pressure conditions (approximately 45 bar) and at
##### ambient temperature, large surface area and pore volumes, tunable
##### pore size, low production cost, superior regeneration stability with
##### low regeneration energy requirements, good selectivity over CH 4
##### and N 2 , fast kinetics, or strong thermal and mechanical stability
##### [ 45 e 47 ]. However, a distinct barrier associated with these mate-
##### rials, and an ongoing research focus to overcome it, is their limited
##### hydrothermal stability, which involves the hydrolysis of Si e O e Si
##### bonds. This limitation can affect their economic feasibility [ 48 ].
##### The ﬁ nal textural characteristics, including speci ﬁ c surface area,
##### pore volume, pore size, and their distribution, can be modi ﬁ ed by
##### adjusting the synthesis process. This offers signi ﬁ cant potential for
##### increasing CO 2 adsorption capacity and addressing speci ﬁ c defects,
##### particularly through surface modi ﬁ cation [ 49 ]. Moreover, silica
##### materials possess morphological ﬂ exibility and porosity, making
##### them amenable to the integration of a wide range of organic and
##### inorganic groups through the functionalization process [ 50 , 51 ].
##### Another avenue of research involves the development of compos-
##### ite/hybrid materials by dispersing nanoparticles of different metals
##### within the porous structure of silica. This approach is advantageous

##### 3.1.1. Silica-based adsorbents
##### Silica is the collective term for a group of minerals found in
##### various forms in the environment, typically as a crystalline solid
##### with high hardness. It comprises silicon and oxygen, two of the
##### most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. One of its most
##### common forms is quartz, which is the planet's most prevalent
##### mineral, constituting around 12% of its composition. The potential
##### use of silica as an adsorbent for CO 2 capture lies in the synthesis of
##### ordered mesoporous materials derived from it, possessing a pre-
##### cisely de ﬁ ned structure. However, amorphous silica presents
##### challenges in supporting CO 2 adsorption. This is due to issues

##### such as chemical grafting or physical impregnation, which have
##### been extensively discussed before [ 55 e 57 ]. On the other hand,

##### review.
##### According to the literature, silica is mainly exploited as a sup-

##### as new advanced materials that show excellent CO 2 adsorption
##### properties. Fatima et al. [ 55 ] collected data on the development and
##### progress of silica functionalized with ILs, the mechanism of inter-
##### action, and the kinetics of CO 2 adsorption. The authors stated that
##### traditional amines may readily be replaced with ionic liquids,
##### which offer tunable physicochemical features such as cation/anion
##### pairing, viscosity, and vapor pressure, among other properties.
##### Some crucial topics that should be addressed were also identi ﬁ ed,
##### including the inability of ILs to be recycled along with the lack of life
##### cycle assessment, limited knowledge of the adsorption mechanism,
##### and the design of equipment for use on an industrial scale.

##### resistance to rapid changes in temperature and pressure [ 94 e 96 ].
##### Among other attributes, they are distinguished by ﬁ ne reproduc-
##### ibility and electronic properties [ 97 , 98 ]. Additionally, they possess
##### the following unique features, which are especially highly relevant
##### for CO 2 capture, as follows: (1) excellent stability, particularly in
##### high and humid environments; (2) a hydrophobic surface, where
##### CO 2 sorption on their surface is not affected by moisture; (3) a
##### reversible nature of physical adsorption, where regeneration con-
##### sumes less energy (weak van der Waals forces); (4) effectively
##### suitable for adsorption usage under atmospheric pressure [ 94 ].
##### Carbon-based adsorbents comprise a diverse range of materials
##### with varying morphologies, structures, and precursor sources.
##### These materials can be broadly categorized into several basic
##### groups, such as activated carbons, hydrochar, biochar, graphene,
##### fullerenes, graphite, and carbon nanotubes ( Fig. 7 ).

##### Zhang et al. [ 57 ] summarized recent advances between 2017 and
##### 2019 in amine-functionalized silica for CO 2 capture. In their sys-
##### tematic review of the literature, the authors found few issues which
##### need to be addressed for future practical applications. In the case of
##### the amine-impregnated silica, while functionalization with high
##### concentrations of amines is advantageous for easy sorbent prepa-
##### ration, a signi ﬁ cant problem with these materials is their stability
##### during many adsorption-desorption cycles. This matter is related to
##### the leaching and degradation of amines, which can potentially be
##### solved by introducing amines with higher boiling points or by
##### reducing the operating temperature. In contrast, amine-grafted sil-
##### ica is stable throughout the cycles, but the amine loading is limited,
##### and the synthesis method is more rigorous, resulting in lower CO 2
##### adsorption capacity. In addition, the authors noted that there is an
##### insuf ﬁ cient number of research results on one-pot synthesis, which
##### should receive moreattention as a researchdirection. Chen et al. [ 56 ]
##### drawn similar conclusions in their paper, which focused on
##### contemporary progress in amine e silica composites, including the
##### preparation and characterization of adsorbents, CO 2 capture under
##### dry and moisture conditions, and stability after many cyclic
##### adsorption  desorption runs. Furthermore, it was shown that
##### although there are several successful methods for immobilizing
##### amine specieson asilica surface through a chemicalgrafting process,
##### innovative procedures capable of achieving larger amine loadings
##### are still required.
##### Future research paths should also consider the potential effects
##### of silica functionalization by an amine moiety in ionic liquids (ILs),

##### 3.2.1. Biochar and hydrochar
##### There has been a notable rise in demand for biomass-derived
##### products along with industrial waste containing char across
##### various economic sectors. This response stems from the pressing
##### environmental challenges we currently face, encompassing CO 2
##### emissions, ##### the ##### climate ##### crisis, ##### and ##### industrial ##### contamination.

##### Nowadays, scientists are concentrating their efforts on developing
##### biochar and hydrochar, mainly due to the cost-effectiveness and
##### sustainability merits [ 99 ].
##### Therefore, the focus has been highly diverted from other
##### carbonaceous materials for the purpose of CO 2 capture. The clas-
##### si ﬁ cation of feedstock employed in the synthesis of biochar and
##### hydrochar is one of the greatest paramount importance in deter-
##### mining the most optimal production method for the conversion
##### process. In view of this, there are many different types of carbon-
##### rich biomass that can serve as perspective, abundant and sustain-
##### able sources. These sources include residues from agriculture or
##### forestry, food and energy crops, animal by-products, wood resi-
##### dues, as well as municipal wastes ( Fig. 8 ) [ 99 , 100 ].
##### Many studies have explored thermal conversion as an alterna-
##### tive path to biomass processing, aiming to generate value-added
##### products for CO 2 applications. This approach can break the chem-
##### ical bonds in organic matter and directly convert its intermediates
##### into char, bio-oil, and syngas [ 101 ]. Consequently, the biomass
##### processing procedure strives to obtain char as a potential adsor-
##### bent, increasing the carbon content within the solid product [ 102 ].
##### The most common ways to produce biochar and hydrochar,
##### respectively, are through the processes of pyrolysis and hydro-
##### thermal carbonization (HTC).

##### relies on thermochemical decomposition of organic matter present
##### in waste biomass into structural carbons within a high pressure and
##### temperature water environment [ 103 ]. HTC is typically performed
##### at temperatures ranging from 180 to 260   C. During this step,
##### biomass and water are combined, then subjected to high pressures
##### of around 2 e 6 MPa for a duration of 5 e 240 min [ 104 , 105 ]. Among
##### the speci ﬁ c parameters of HTC, process water exhibits character-
##### istics akin to those of organic solvents and function as a catalyst in
##### the biomass transformation through decarboxylation, condensa-
##### tion, aromatization, hydrolysis, and dehydration [ 106 ]. The result-
##### ing product based on converting organic material consists of
##### carbonized material (hydrochar), liquid bio-oil, and gaseous vola-
##### tile vapors. The ﬁ nal solid product preserves a considerable per-
##### centage of the original biomass structure, making it particularly
##### valuable for carbon dioxide storage applications [ 107 ]. HTC char
##### generally retains between 55 and 90% of the original mass of the
##### feedstock while possessing 80 e 95% of its energy content [ 108 ].
##### Recently, a few reviews related to this research scope were
##### published between 2018 and 2021. Goel et al. [ 103 ] examined fac-
##### tors necessary for achieving higher yields of biochar and hydrochar
##### suitable for CO 2 capture. The authors highlighted several crucial
##### process parameters affecting the sorption properties of the ﬁ nal
##### HTC product, including the type of feedstock, temperature, pres-
##### sure, residence time, biomass-to-process water ratio, and the use of
##### a catalyst. Fang et al. [ 109 ] presented a concise summary of the
##### potential applications of hydrochar and outlined the primary steps
##### involved in the hydrothermal carbonization of biomass. They

##### mal carbonization, abbreviated as HTC, which may be used to

##### brought attention to the necessity for unique syntheses and crea-
##### tive manufacturing techniques that are crucial for the development
##### of value-added tailored carbon products from hydrochar. Moreover,
##### to promote the practical implementation of hydrochar on an in-
##### dustrial scale, support for the concept of engineered hydrochar is
##### also necessary in the research ﬁ eld. Unfortunately, there is still a
##### noticeable lack of a critical literature review closely related to
##### hydrochar for CO 2 capture and its utilization in cyclic regeneration
##### systems at different scale. Precise systematization of current
##### knowledge would signi ﬁ cantly improve the scaling process of using
##### these materials and increase their technological maturity.
##### Hydrochar itself obtained exclusively from the HTC process
##### often exhibits a poorly developed microporosity and a low speci ﬁ c
##### surface area, posing challenges for its use in CO 2 sorption purposes
##### [ 110 ]. To improve the above properties, physical or chemical acti-
##### vation is widely reported as essential step to synthesize biomass-
##### derived activated carbons ( Fig. 9 ). As section 3.2.2 is devoted to
##### ACs and the activation processes, the most important theoretic
##### aspects of this material will be covered there.










##### 3.2.1.2. Biochar. Biochar is a carbonaceous material obtained by
##### pyrolysis, which involves the thermal decomposition of biomass
##### under the in ﬂ uence of elevated temperature (ranging from 300 to
##### 650  C) in the absence of oxygen or other oxidizing agents.
##### Following the completion of this process, three distinct groupings
##### of products are created: gaseous (volatile parts), liquid (polycyclic
##### aromatic hydrocarbons and water, the so-called bio-oil), and solid
##### (high-carbon solid residue as well as ash, termed as biochar) [ 111 ].
##### A solid char, as in the case of hydrothermal carbonization, due to its
##### porous structure, the prospect for a large storage capacity, and the
##### existence of fundamental functional groups, has been recognized as
##### an ecologically favorable and sustainable material in terms of CO 2
##### capture [ 112 ]. Considering a supply of biomass, it is approximately
##### 10 times less expensive than other CO 2 adsorbents on the market
##### and the cost of production is approximately one-sixth of that of ACs
##### [ 113 ]. First and foremost, biochar is stable and does not degrade
##### easily, its carbon half-life is between 100 and 10 7  years during
##### exposition to ambient oxidation [ 114 ]. The ability of biochar to
##### adsorb CO 2 is largely determined by its physicochemical charac-
##### teristics, such as speci ﬁ c surface area, pore sizes, total pore volume,
##### basicity of biochar surface, presence and type of surface functional
##### groups, appearance of alkali and alkali earth metals, hydrophobic-
##### ity, polarity, and aromaticity [ 115 ]. The aforementioned properties
##### are inherently interconnected with the composition of the feed-
##### stock used in its formation as well as the thermochemical condi-
##### tions. Biochar main component is obviously carbon, but there is
##### also hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, a mineral substance, and trace
##### amounts of sulfur [ 116 ]. Low-mineral biochars with a high content
##### of carbon element are used for energy applications and the pro-
##### duction of ACs. Consequently, the substantial concentration of
##### mineral substances in biochars may potentially provide a bene ﬁ cial
##### effect on fertilizer and sorption utilization [ 117 ].
##### Many review articles have described the current state of
##### knowledge on biochar between 2019 and 2022, with a particular
##### emphasis on its use in CO 2 adsorption, as opposed to hydrochar.
##### Jung et al. [ 118 ] devoted signi ﬁ cant attention to advancing current
##### research on activated biochars for CO 2 adsorption, derived from
##### various biomass sources. According to the ﬁ nal ﬁ ndings of authors,
##### the production of activated biochars from biomass holds promise as
##### a viable approach for creating the required CO 2 capture materials.
##### However, consideration needs to be given to the optimization of
##### pyrolysis and activation parameters to enhance energy ef ﬁ ciency,

##### Among the activating gases, CO 2 is considered one of the most
##### advantageous factors due to its ability to create narrow micropores
##### of large volume, suitable for the kinematic diameter of the CO 2
##### molecule [ 143 ]. In the case of AC activation with steam, the existing
##### pores are enlarged [ 140 ]. In the case of activation with steam, the
##### existing pores are enlarged [ 140 ]. On the other hand, using a gas
##### mixture of H 2 O þ O 2 as an activating agent leads to rapid reaction
##### kinetics, resulting in an active carbon structure with random
##### porosity and substantial char losses. Consequently, its use is not
##### recommended [ 144 e 146 ]. The effect of activation gases is also
##### chemical in nature and involves the elemental carbon oxidation of
##### material. For activation with CO 2 , the general reaction, also known
##### as the Boudouard reaction, may be described as follows [ 140 ]:

#### C þ CO 2 / 2 CO D H ¼ þ 171  kJ #### mol
#### (1)

##### The above reaction can be written in more details by separating
##### it ##### into ##### two ##### distinct ##### phases, ##### i.e., ##### dissociative ##### chemisorption
##### (involving the dissociation of CO 2 on the surface of carbon material
##### along with the formation of an oxide on its surface) and desorption
##### of the surface oxide (in which the oxide is desorbed from the sur-
##### face, and CO is produced) [ 147 ]:

##### material sources, along with the production on an industrial scale,
##### offer a signi ﬁ cant competitive edge to ACs compared to other ad-
##### sorbents. However, due to the quite diverse properties of raw ma-
##### terials, activated carbons are characterized by a different structure
##### (porosity and speci ﬁ c surface area), implying that the overall course
##### of the CO 2 adsorption process is changeable [ 131 ].
##### Activated carbons offer a wide distribution of an extensive porous
##### structure, mainly microporous and mesoporous, where the size of
##### the speci ﬁ c surface ranges from 500 to about 3000 m 2 /g [ 137 ]. The
##### pores within the ACs structure may have different shapes depending
##### on the type of hysteresis loop present in the multilayer range of
##### physisorption isotherms. In most cases, they correspond to H1
##### (nearly vertical and parallel adsorption and desorption branches)
##### and H2 (sloping adsorption branch and nearly vertical desorption
##### branch) types, de ﬁ ning the shape of the pores as cylinders open on
##### both sides, or alternatively, as ink bottle-shaped pore.
##### The CO 2 adsorption capacity of ACs can also be increased by the
##### presence of heteroatomic functional groups in the form of con-
##### nections: carbon e oxygen, carbon e nitrogen or carbon e sulfur on its
##### surface. They can be categorized into acidic, such as carboxyl,
##### lactone, or phenolic groups, and basic, including chromene, ketone,
##### or pyrone groups [ 138 ]. The most important functional groups
##### contain oxygen atoms, which contribute the outer surface a hy-
##### drophilic (polar) nature, in addition to the hydrophobic (nonpolar)
##### character shown by the internal structure. The inherent duality of
##### ACs surfaces enables them to effectively adsorb a diverse array of
##### gases, with a particular emphasis on greenhouse gases (GHGs),
##### therefore mitigating their release into the atmosphere.

##### 3.2.2.1. Physical activation. Thermochemical conversion (hydro-
##### thermal carbonization, or pyrolysis) and activation are the two
##### basic steps in the preparation of ACs. The char structure with un-
##### developed porosity (especially microporosity) and a small speci ﬁ c
##### surface, which for a signi ﬁ cant useful applications of CO 2 adsorp-
##### tion, are unsatisfactory, as highlighted before [ 131 , 139 ]. To improve
##### the above parameters, the activation process (physical or chemical)
##### is performed, by using a speci ﬁ c thermal treatment, which ulti-
##### mately facilitates the improvement of carbon dioxide storage ef ﬁ -
##### ciency. Speci ﬁ cally, this treatment leads to the expansion or
##### creation of new pores at both the micro and meso sizes.
##### Physical activation entails the partial gasi ﬁ cation of raw mate-
##### rials in the presence of oxidizing gases at a temperature of 800   C-
##### 1000   C, such as water vapor, CO 2 , air, or their mixtures [ 140 ]. The
##### process can be classi ﬁ ed into two distinct ways, either in combi-
##### nation with thermochemical conversion or as an independent
##### operation, i.e., the direct approach and the two-step approach. In
##### the direct way, thermochemical conversion is performed in the
##### presence of nitrogen ﬂ ow until the reaction is complete. The N 2
##### ﬂ ow is then stopped, and the activation gas is immediately intro-
##### duced at the temperature. In the case of the second method, the
##### activation process is divided into two steps. During it, the conver-
##### sion of feedstock is carried out while maintaining a continuous
##### supply of nitrogen ﬂ ow. The process mentioned continues until an
##### adequate amount of carbonaceous material is generated and
##### collected afterward, then the activation is processed [ 141 , 142 ].

##### The development of char porosity, speci ﬁ cally the capillary
##### structure, as a direct outcome of physical activation occurs
##### through the reaction of oxidizing gases with amorphous carbon.
##### These activating gases penetrate the internal structure of the
##### precursor surface, resulting in the opening and widening of pre-
##### viously inaccessible pores and the creation of new ones [ 151 ]. This
##### process is the effect of complex mechanisms, including the
##### diffusion of reactants to the surface of the carbon material and
##### into the pores, their chemisorption on the surface, chemical re-
##### actions, and the subsequent desorption of reaction products.
##### Additionally, physical activation promotes the presence of func-
##### tional groups containing oxygen atoms, such as phenolic, ketone,
##### and carboxyl groups [ 152 ].
##### To date, CO 2 capture has been achieved using various of
##### physically activated carbon adsorbents from char, as given in
##### Table 6 . The majority of research ﬁ ndings highlight the potential of
##### biomass as a viable and sustainable raw material for AC synthesis
##### through physical activation. Currently, laboratory-scale research
##### primarily concentrates on identifying new precursors and opti-
##### mizing activation parameters to enhance CO 2 uptake.
##### Li et al. [ 153 ] synthesized AC from rice husk that was leached
##### with potassium carbonate after being activated with CO 2 . The
##### resulting material was then examined for its CO 2 adsorption ca-
##### pacity, kinetics, and regeneration. The studies revealed that the
##### activated carbon possessed a dual pore structure comprising mi-
##### cropores and mesopores. The BET speci ﬁ c surface area, mesopores
##### volume, and micropores volume were 1097 m 2 /g, 0.49 cm 3 /g, and
##### 0.34 cm 3 /g, respectively. The developed AC demonstrated both a
##### high CO 2 adsorption capacity, reaching 3.1 mmol/g, and excellent
##### CO 2 selectivity of 7.6 at 25   C and 1 bar, respectively. These values
##### were comparable to those of AC produced by chemical activation
##### with KOH serving as the activator.
##### Rashidi et al. [ 154 ] conducted research on the volumetric CO 2
##### adsorption utilizing AC made from palm kernel shells. The carbon
##### was directly activated at 850  C for 1 h. The obtained AC
##### demonstrated ##### a ##### satisfactory ##### CO 2 ##### adsorption ##### capacity ##### of
##### 2.13 mmol/g along with excellent regeneration performance of 7.0
##### and stability after many cycles.
##### Ogungbenro et al. [ 156 ] investigated the preparation of AC
##### from date fruits as a promising adsorbent material. The AC syn-
##### thesis involved pyrolysis in a furnace, followed by activation in a
##### carbon dioxide environment at temperatures ranging from 600 to
##### 900   C. Among the samples, the one pyrolyzed at 800   C and
##### activated at 900   C for 1 h exhibited the highest CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity, reaching 3.21 mmol/g. This can be attributed to its su-
##### perior textural properties, including a BET speci ﬁ c surface area of
##### 798.38 m 2 /g, a micropore area of 712.87 m 2 /g, and a micropore
##### volume of 0.28 cm 3 /g.
##### Puig-Gamero et al. [ 159 ] studied the in ﬂ uence of physical
##### activation parameters involving CO 2 and steam on the production
##### of AC derived from olive stones and its CO 2 adsorption capabilities.
##### For H 2 O activation, the determined conditions were 900  C,
##### 30 min, 0.15 ml/min, and 1 bar. In the case of CO 2 activation, the
##### optimal conditions were found to be 900   C, 30 min, 300 ml/min,
##### and 1 bar. Furthermore, the ACs demonstrated respectable CO 2
##### adsorption capacity of 4.28 and 4.66 mmol/g at 30   C and 10 bar,
##### with BET speci ﬁ c surface area of 955.06 and 1190.65 m 2 /g, and
##### total pore volumes of 0.44 and 0.69 cm 3 /g for CO 2 and H 2 O acti-
##### vation, respectively.
##### To sum up, several comparative studies have been conducted in
##### recent years to evaluate various activating agents for physical
##### activation. The physical activation method of steam activation is
##### widely utilized, yielding activated carbon possessing a substantial
##### surface area and micropore volume. However, the process neces-
##### sitates elevated temperatures and prolonged activation periods,

17

##### resulting in a high demand for energy and a prolonged duration. On
##### the other hand, the use of CO 2 as an activating agent requires less
##### energy and can be carried out at lower temperatures compared to
##### steam activation. The process yields activated carbon that exhibits
##### substantial surface area and pore volume, albeit potentially leading
##### to a reduced micropore volume relative to steam-activated carbon.
##### Further, air activation has the capability to generate activated carbon
##### featuring diverse pore sizes and surface areas. Its application is not as
##### frequent owing to the potential hazard of oxidation and combustion
##### of the precursor material. In general, the selection of physical acti-
##### vating agent is contingent upon the intended characteristics of the
##### resultant activated carbon. Although steam activation remains the
##### predominant technique, CO 2 activation is increasingly being adopted
##### owing to its reduced energy demands. Although less frequently
##### employed, air activation has the potential to provide a broader
##### spectrum of pore sizes and surface areas.

##### Generally, CO 2 adsorption mechanism depends on the type and
##### volume of pores in the ACs structure. Carbon materials with mi-
##### cropores, especially pores with diameters less than 1 nm, were
##### found to show a high capacity to adsorb CO 2 [ 188 , 189 ]. In addition,
##### these pore sizes favor the diffusion of CO 2 in the materials, which
##### makes the adsorption kinetics very fast [ 190 ]. For several years, the
##### interest of researchers has focused on the use of waste residues and
##### biomass as a precursor to produce activated carbons. Among the
##### works published between 2010 and 2022, there are several that
##### have contributed in particular to this ﬁ eld of research.
##### Hu et al. [ 191 ] obtained activated carbons for CO 2 adsorption
##### using petroleum coke as a precursor. The authors employed various
##### ratios of KOH to carbon, and the most favorable CO 2 adsorption
##### results were achieved when the ratio of KOH to the carbon pre-
##### cursor was 3. Under these conditions, the material adsorbed
##### 3.5 mmol/g of CO 2 at a temperature of 25   C and a pressure of 1 bar.
##### This carbon was shown to be characterized by a signi ﬁ cant
##### advantage in micropore volume with diameters less than 1 nm
##### compared to other pores.
##### Ouzzine et al. [ 192 ] prepared activated carbon from pome-
##### granate peel (PP). Optimal conditions for CO 2 adsorption were
##### evaluated by controlling the activation temperature. KOH was used
##### as an activating agent in a KOH/PP activating ratio of 1:1. Four
##### activated carbons were synthesized at activation temperatures in
##### the range of 600 e 900   C, and their surface and pore characteristics
##### were examined along with CO 2 adsorption. The results showed that
##### with the increase of the activation temperature from 600 to 800   C,
##### the total pore volume and the speci ﬁ c surface area increased
##### considerably from 0.78 to 1.28 cm 3 /g and from 1311 to 2141 m 2 /g,
##### respectively. ##### However, ##### the ##### values ##### of ##### these ##### two ##### parameters
##### decreased at temperatures above 900   C. The best CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity of 4.44 mmol/g and 5.53 mmol/g was obtained for acti-
##### vated carbon prepared at 800   C at 25 and 0   C at 1 bar, respectively.
##### This result highlights the importance of the structural and textural
##### characteristics of activated carbons, prepared at different activation
##### temperatures, on the CO 2 adsorption behavior.
##### Acevedo et al. [ 193 ] investigated the preparation of porous
##### activated carbon from the chemical activation of African palm shells
##### sourced from crops in the Guajira region, Colombia. They utilized
##### solutions of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 and Cu(NO 3 ) 2 with varying concentrations
##### and conducted the activation process at two different temperatures
##### of 700   C and 800   C. The obtained material presented micro-
##### mesoporosity with surface area between 5 and 1300 m 2 /g. The
##### ﬁ xed carbon content ranged from 47.1% to 78.4%. These results
##### indicated that the activation process had notable effects on the
##### textural ##### parameters, ##### elemental ##### composition, ##### and ##### proximal
##### composition of the obtained solids. Additionally, the CO 2 uptake
##### values at low pressures were between from 1.82 to 5.68 mmol/g.
##### Ello et al. [ 194 ] prepared microporous activated carbon from
##### palm shells for CO 2 capture. The volume of micropores and the
##### speci ﬁ c surface area of the obtained carbons varied depending on
##### the ratio of KOH to the carbon precursor, ranging from 0.16 cm 3 /g
##### (365 m 2 /g) to 0.82 cm 3 /g (1890 m 2 /g). Among these carbons, the
##### one with a speci ﬁ c surface area of 1250 m 2 /g and an ultramicropore
##### volume (diameter less than 0.7 nm) of 0.29 cm 3 /g proved to be the
##### most effective CO 2 capture material. At 1 bar and 0   C, it exhibited
##### CO 2 adsorption capacity of 6.3 mmol/g. Interestingly, activated
##### carbon with a higher speci ﬁ c surface area (1890 m 2 /g) showed
##### lower CO 2 uptake and a reduced ultramicropore volume.
##### Similar research results were presented by Zhu et al. [ 197 ], who
##### tested the carbon obtained from sawdust in the CO 2 adsorption
##### process. They noted that the carbon material with the highest
##### speci ﬁ c surface area of 2435 m 2 /g was not characterized by the best
##### CO 2 adsorption capacity. The authors concluded that the reason

##### 3.2.2.2. Chemical activation. Chemical activation concerns the re-
##### action of char with chemical reagents, followed by subjecting it to
##### heat treatment under neutral conditions. This method leads to the
##### production of ACs within a temperature range of 450 e 900   C [ 170 ].
##### The two most common chemical activation procedures are a single
##### step approach, known as dry mixing, and a two step approach
##### referred to as wet impregnation [ 171 ]. The difference between the
##### two is related to the environment for carrying out the activation
##### reaction and the number of sequential steps required in achieving
##### the ﬁ nal product. The wet impregnation method involves the
##### addition of an AC precursor to a saturated solution of an activating
##### agent, followed by heating and drying. The dried mixture is then
##### activated under a nitrogen gas atmosphere in a furnace. Subse-
##### quently, the activated material undergoes a washing process prior
##### to a further drying step. On the other hand, the dry mixing
##### approach is characterized by its simplicity, involving mixing of a
##### solid activating agent with the particular raw material. Then, the
##### mixture also is directly subjected to carbonization and activation in
##### a single step, maintaining an atmosphere of N 2 gas [ 172 ].
##### The development of porous structure through chemical activa-
##### tion is in ﬂ uenced by several factors, including the content of
##### organic or synthetic raw material, activation temperature, resi-
##### dence time, heating rate, type of activating agent, and the weight
##### ratio between AC precursor and activating agent [ 173 e 175 ].
##### Chemical activation provides a number of bene ﬁ ts over physical
##### activation, such as a reduction in temperature and activation time
##### [ 176 , 177 ], higher carbon yield, more porous structure of activated
##### carbon, low energy and operating cost, or easier development of
##### microporosity [ 132 , 178 ]. It has also been observed that chemically
##### activated chars have higher carbon yields and surface areas than
##### physically activated ones [ 179 ]. Conversely, the chemical activation
##### has several drawbacks, including an additional rinse step to remove
##### excess chemical agent, and secondary contamination issues along
##### with their ecological disposal [ 180 ].
##### Commercially available ACs have a relatively low CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity due to the wide pore size distribution [ 181 , 182 ]. In order to
##### achieve high CO 2 adsorption, various chemicals are utilized in the
##### chemical activation to regulate the pore network, which fall into

##### reduced CO 2 uptake.
##### In summary, the utilization of KOH is frequently favored over
##### alternative chemical agents owing to its capacity to generate
##### structures that are highly porous and possess extensive speci ﬁ c
##### surface areas. The heightened chemical reactivity of KOH facilitates
##### a more ef ﬁ cient reaction with the precursor material at lower
##### temperatures, ultimately resulting in the generation of a greater
##### quantity of micropores and mesopores. Furthermore, potassium
##### hydroxide is a cost-effective and easily accessible option, rendering
##### it a feasible alternative for mass manufacturing.

##### represented only 29% of the total pore volume. On the other hand,
##### the maximum CO 2 uptake of 8.0 mmol/g at a pressure of 1 bar at a
##### temperature of 0   C was obtained on activated carbon with a much
##### lower speci ﬁ c surface, but with a high volume of micropores,
##### constituting 73% of the pore volume. Therefore, the proper micro-
##### pore fraction in the carbon structure was found to be the main
##### factor contributing to CO 2 adsorption.
##### Sevilla et al. [ 222 ] used eucalyptus sawdust, cellulose, and po-
##### tato starch as precursors to produce KOH-activated carbons. They
##### prepared several series of activated carbons that differed in the
##### ratio of KOH to the carbon precursor and in the activation tem-
##### perature. The carbon samples obtained at the activation tempera-
##### ture of 600   C showed the highest CO 2 capture capacity at room
##### temperature (4.8 mmol/g, 250   C and 1 bar). The authors associated
##### the high adsorption of CO 2 with the presence of narrow micropores
##### (diameter &lt; 1 nm). The speci ﬁ c surface area was found to play a less
##### signi ﬁ cant role. In addition, there was an observation made that the
##### obtained carbons under mild activation conditions at temperatures
##### of 600 e 800   C, are characterized by higher CO 2 uptake. It was
##### found that using the ratio of KOH to precursor equal to 2 led to the
##### formation of materials characterized by an increased number of
##### pores with widths below 0.8 nm.
##### The increase in pore diameters causes a decrease in CO 2 uptake,
##### in line with the previously discussed concept that pores with vol-
##### umes less than 1 nm play a predominant role in CO 2 adsorption
##### under ambient conditions. Presser et al. [ 195 ] found that the vol-
##### ume of pores with diameters less than 0.8 nm correlated with the
##### amount of CO 2 adsorbed at 0   C and a pressure of 1 bar. Therefore,
##### the authors stated that micropores smaller than 0.8 nm play a
##### dominant role in CO 2 adsorption under these conditions.
##### Wei et al. [ 196 ] also conducted studies on activated carbons
##### derived from biomass for CO 2 adsorption and arrived at similar
##### conclusions. Activated carbons with a high CO 2 adsorption capacity
##### were produced from bamboo using KOH as the activator. The
##### maximum amount of CO 2 adsorbed at the temperature of 0   C and
##### the pressure of 1 bar was 7.0 mmol/g. The study aimed to identify
##### the pores responsible for CO 2 adsorption, revealing a strong linear
##### correlation between the amount of CO 2 uptake and the size of pores
##### with diameters less than 0.82 nm. The authors found that pores in
##### the range of 0.33 e 0.82 nm were mainly responsible for CO 2
##### adsorption at 0   C and 1 bar pressure.
##### Based on the literature review and the ﬁ ndings presented in

##### 3.2.2.3. Modi ﬁ cation strategies of activated carbons. By applying
##### speci ﬁ c strategy methods, the key disadvantages of ACs merit
##### attention, i.e., susceptibility to SO x , NO x , and H 2 O impurities in the
##### ﬂ ue gas stream, low balance, less effective adsorption capacity at
##### low partial CO 2 pressures, and a decrease in adsorption ef ﬁ ciency
##### with increasing process temperature [ 131 ]. Therefore, to eliminate
##### the in ﬂ uence of the above drawbacks on CO 2 adsorption, many
##### studies described in the scienti ﬁ c literature focused primarily on:
##### (1) modi ﬁ cation of the synthesis condition (thermochemical con-
##### version, or activation process), which were previously discussed;
##### (2) ##### surface ##### modi ﬁ cations ##### (high ##### temperature ##### NH 3 ##### treatment
##### [ 224 , 225 ], amine functionalization [ 226 , 227 ]); (3) development of
##### activated carbon composites (carbon-based nanomaterials [ 228 ],
##### polymers [ 229 e 231 ], metal oxides/metal impregnation [ 232 , 233 ],
##### zeolites [ 234 e 237 ], metal-organic frameworks [ 238 , 239 ]) ( Fig. 12 ).
##### The combinations of the above modi ﬁ cation strategies have also
##### been reported in the literature and seems to be a very promising
##### solution for increasing CO 2 capture. They are closely related to the
##### optimization of the synthesis conditions with high temperature
##### NH 3 treatment [ 205 ], amine functionalization [ 240 ], or metal
##### impregnation.
##### Zhang et al. [ 205 ] improved CO 2 adsorption by biochar synthesis
##### modi ﬁ cation (chemical activation of KOH) in conjunction with
##### surface modi ﬁ cation by heat treatment of NH 3 resulted in the
##### development of microporosity and the introduction of basic
##### nitrogen-containing groups into biomass-based carbon material.
##### The high CO 2 uptake of 7.19 mmol/g and 5.05 mmol/g at 0 and 25   C
##### were achieved due to the development of the micropore structure
##### and the abundance of basic nitrogen-containing functionalities,
##### which enhanced CO 2 adsorption at higher adsorption tempera-
##### tures. According to the ﬁ ndings, the modi ﬁ ed activated carbon
##### contained a high surface area, measuring 2511 m 2 /g, as well as a
##### signi ﬁ cant micropore volume, reaching 1.16 cm 3 /g.
##### Liu et al. [ 240 ] reported an effective synthesis of hierarchical
##### ultra-micro/mesoporous biocarbons by chemical activation and
##### amine functionalization (MEA). At ambient temperature and low
##### CO 2 partial pressure, the biocarbons displayed high adsorption
##### capacities (1.90 mmol/g) at 25   C and 15 kPa CO 2 and record high
##### Henry's law CO 2 /N 2 selectivity up to 212. The ﬁ nal results estab-
##### lished that the unique surface textural features high mesoporosity
##### and ultra-microporosity of 0.175 cm 3 /g with a restricted pore size
##### distribution, large speci ﬁ c surface are of 1190 m 2 /g and increased
##### surface chemistry. These factors combined to provide favorable
##### conditions for CO 2 adsorption with strong selectivity for CO 2 /N 2 at
##### low partial pressures of CO 2 , while the presence of mesoporosity
##### signi ﬁ cantly enhanced CO 2 adsorption kinetics.
##### In recent years, researchers have been more interested in pro-
##### ducing AC composites, which are very effective path for increasing
##### CO 2 uptake and selectivity. The utilization of AC composites is
##### principally noteworthy due to their synergistic impact on the CO 2
##### adsorption ef ﬁ ciency of the constituent materials.
##### Othman et al. [ 241 ] combined activated carbon nano ﬁ bers
##### (ACNFs) with four different types of metal oxides, including

##### Table 7 , KOH emerges as the most frequently used reagent in
##### chemical activation for CO 2 adsorption compared to the others. It is
##### widely considered as one of the chemicals for improving CO 2
##### adsorption capacity and selectivity, enhancing the microporosity,
##### increasing surface area, and subduing the generation of tar. How-
##### ever, an excess of KOH blocks pores and reduces the surface area
##### [ 197 e 200 ]. The superior performance of KOH is evident in the
##### research examples carried out with the utilization of other acti-
##### vating agents. For example, Shen et al. [ 201 ] used coal pitch as a
##### precursor of activated carbons, activated with steam. The ACs
##### showed low CO 2 uptake at the level of 1.9 mmol/g at a temperature
##### of 30   C and a pressure of 1 bar. Plaza et al. [ 202 ] produced a series
##### of ACs by the activation of olive pits with carbon dioxide. The
##### maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity value that could be obtained on
##### these carbons was 2.4 mmol/g at a temperature of 25   C and a
##### pressure of 1 bar. The use of carbon dioxide as activating agent
##### resulted in ACs with lower CO 2 adsorption performance compared
##### to KOH-ACs. Lastly, Goel et al. [ 103 ] in their review identi ﬁ ed the
##### ideal synthesis and process working conditions for chemical acti-
##### vation via KOH, such as a KOH/char ratio of 2 e 3, an activation
##### temperature of 700   C, and an optimal CO 2 adsorption temperature
##### of below 50   C. They also emphasized that increasing the KOH/char
##### ratio beyond 3 may enhance the surface area, but larger pore sizes

##### From recent reviews on ACs for CO 2 capture, in 2021 Abd et al.
##### [ 138 ] made attempts to examine the adsorption characteristics of
##### carbon dioxide on activated carbons produced from a variety of
##### sources. They drew attention to the current performance, prepa-
##### ration, and surface modi ﬁ cation of ACs for future research progress
##### or improvement. They outlined several important directions that
##### future research should focus on, including: novel structures of AC
##### materials that are resistant to harsh process environment condi-
##### tions (high temperatures and moisture level in ﬂ ue gas stream);
##### necessary academic cooperation for the manufacturing, character-
##### ization, and performance modeling of AC; more investigation on
##### the price of producing AC at a larger scale, since it is crucial to

##### magnesium oxide (MgO), manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ), zinc oxide

##### when compared to pristine material and other composites. It also
##### exhibited the maximum CO 2 adsorption at 25   C, with a capacity of
##### 2.08 mmol/g. According to these ﬁ ndings, the integration of MgO
##### into ACNFs led to the greatest improvement in the physicochemical
##### qualities of all treatments. Metal impregnation mainly increased
##### CO 2 adsorption capacity due to the high af ﬁ nity between metals
##### and CO 2 molecules, especially at elevated temperatures.
##### Liu et al. [ 242 ] created innovative composites by combining Cu-

##### 2.11 mmol/g at 20 wt% was observed, respectively. On the other
##### hand, higher amounts of PEI ( &gt; 20 wt%) caused decreasing the ef-
##### ﬁ ciency of CO 2 adsorption. Lee et al. [ 264 ] also used MWCNTs to
##### impregnate them with PEI. They reached the same conclusions,
##### ﬁ nding that attaching amino groups to the carbon surface in the
##### impregnation process leaves oxygen af ﬁ nity sites, which increases
##### sorption ef ﬁ ciency. Rahimi et al. [ 256 ] instead, used diamine pre-
##### cursor (1,3-diaminopropane) for the modi ﬁ cation of multi-walled
##### carbon nanotubes, which improved the CO 2 adsorption capacity
##### of MWCNTs from 1.10 to 2.11 mmol/g.
##### Additionally, Keller et al. [ 270 ] noticed the high potential use-
##### fulness of a composite based on CNTs and silica, due to the reduced
##### pressure drop, lower energy consumption, higher CO 2 recovery,
##### and thermal and chemical stability. Silica particles were dispersed
##### in the CNTs network, and polyethyleneimine was immobilized in
##### the hollow ﬁ bers to increase the ef ﬁ ciency of CO 2 sorption. The
##### application of silica particles improved the speci ﬁ c surface area of
##### the composite to 283.2 m 2 /g. Nevertheless, the impact of the in-
##### crease in PEI loading was more pronounced, resulting in a higher
##### CO 2 uptake of 1.92 mmol/g.
##### Another interesting direction is the development of composite
##### materials is a synthesis of hierarchically porous MWCNTs/carbon
##### foam (CF) nanocomposites based on biomass. The results obtained
##### by Zhang et al. [ 272 ], which determined the in ﬂ uence of the
##### amount of MWCNTs on the mechanical properties, the pore
##### structure of CF and the composite, showed a unique potential both
##### in terms of CO 2 capture and energy storage of these materials. Due
##### to a more developed hierarchical porosity, in particular ultra-
##### microporosity with a pore size from 0.50 to 0.80 nm and meso-
##### pores with an average size of about 3.70 e 3.90 nm. The MWCNTs
##### contained in the foam signi ﬁ cantly increased the compressive
##### strength of CF (by 113%), and also improved the thermal stability
##### and the degree of graphitization. The CO 2 adsorption capacity of the
##### nanocomposite reached a high value of 4.58 and 3.19 mmol/g at
##### 0 and 25   C, respectively.

##### 3.2.4. Fullerenes
##### Fullerenes are also one of the allotropic forms of carbon that has
##### been shown to be effective in separation and storage of a wide
##### range of gases from simple monoatomic to polyatomic, including
##### H 2 , and CO 2 [ 283 e 286 ]. They possess interesting physicochemical
##### properties, considering their carbon atom bonding structure, which
##### is uniform and demonstrates sp 2  hybridization. The structure of
##### fullerenes can additionally be illustrated as a twisted layer of a
##### graphene sheet, in which the carbon atoms form pentagonal or
##### hexagonal con ﬁ gurations, resulting in a three-dimensional spatial
##### architecture [ 287 ]. The most frequently considered as a potential
##### adsorbent is icosahedral fullerene, composed of 60 carbon atoms
##### (C60), due to its exceptional chemical stability [ 288 ]. However,
##### other forms of fullerenes are also being explored in the context of
##### improving CO 2 capture, such as B 40 [ 289 e 292 ], B 80 [ 293 ], or C 24 N 24
##### [ 294 ].
##### Studies with fullerene primarily concern the utilization of DFT
##### approaches ( Fig. 15 ). The methodology for investigating fullerenes
##### via DFT entails the optimization of geometry, selection of a suitable
##### level of theory and basis set, computation of electronic structure
##### and properties, and examination of vibrational modes, electron
##### density, and charge distribution. Upon completion of the DFT cal-
##### culations, a range of properties pertaining to the fullerene structure
##### can be computed, including but not limited to the electronic den-
##### sity of states, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and the vibrational spectra.
##### Recently, that method was used in few research regarding fullerene
##### to investigate the potential of them to capture and store CO 2

##### 3.2.3. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
##### Carbon dioxide adsorption on carbon nanotubes is receiving a
##### growing experimental and theoretical focus due to their structure
##### similar to activated carbons, favorable surface properties, topo-
##### logical hollow tube structures, high mechanical strength, very low
##### weight, thermal and chemical stability, and bene ﬁ cial pore size
##### distribution [ 254 e 256 ]. The cross-sectional diameter of CNTs may
##### reach magnitudes of tens of nanometers, although their length can
##### extend to several thousand times more. Their internal structure
##### focuses on the interactions between graphene layers, rolled up into
##### a uniform cylinder, which is empty inside. This tubular geometry
##### enables the gas distribution and residence time to be controlled.
##### The amount of adsorbed CO 2 in carbon nanotubes is determined by
##### gas pressure, temperature, their diameter in the entire volume of
##### the material, and the distance between adjacent layers graphene
##### [ 257 ].
##### The main possibility of the systematic division of carbon nano-
##### tubes can be based on the number of graphene layers present in
##### their spatial structure (walls), therefore the following are distin-
##### guished: single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double walled
##### carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), multi walled carbon nanotubes
##### (MWCNTs). The three-dimensional representations of SWCNTs,
##### DWCNTs, MWCNTs, are given in Fig. 13 . Each of the above forms has
##### been found to be an effective adsorbent material for speci ﬁ c
##### gaseous media. The number of graphene layers additionally affects
##### the properties of nanotubes, i.e., mechanical (tensile strength) and
##### thermal parameters. Moreover, single-walled carbon nanotubes
##### (SWCNTs) are distinguished by a large speci ﬁ c surface area, usually
##### between 400 and 3000 m 2 /g, which is comparable to the activated
##### carbons [ 258 ]. Nonetheless, MWCNTs are considered to be a su-
##### perior CO 2 capture materials than SWCNTs [ 259 , 260 ].
##### The CNTs also offer the possibility of modifying their surface by
##### adding chemical groups [ 261 , 262 ]. All ways of functionalizing car-
##### bon nanotubes fall into one of two categories: internal function-
##### alization and external chemical functionalization (based on the
##### mechanism of attaching compounds and groups). Chemical func-
##### tionalization can be further divided into three subgroups as fol-
##### lows: (1) adding functional groups to defects or ends of carbon
##### nanotubes for covalent functionalization, (2) “ side wall function-
##### alization ” for covalent functionalization, and 3) non-covalent
##### functionalization, such as the use of surfactants to wrap carbon
##### nanotubes in polymers [ 256 ].
##### Many studies on modi ﬁ cation strategies to enhance CO 2
##### adsorption capacity of CNTs, have focused on the nitrogen doping
##### via amines on the surface of CNTs [ 263 e 266 ]; treatment methods
##### by chemical agents [ 267 , 268 ]; synthesis of hybrid materials with
##### MOFs (creation of hierarchical structures composed of functional-
##### ized MWCNTs and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks) [ 269 ], silica
##### [ 270 ], deposition of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) [ 271 ], and
##### carbon foams [ 272 ]; or the combination of approaches listed above.
##### The generic CNTs modi ﬁ cation strategies and research paths are
##### presented in Fig. 14 .
##### Based on the review, the amine functionalized CNTs are sug-
##### gested to be very suitable, non-toxic, materials for further devel-
##### opment of CO 2 capture processes from ﬂ ue gas streams. Keller et al.
##### [ 263 ] functionalized highly porous multi-walled carbon nanotube
##### based microtubes with polyethyleneimine. In the case of low PEI
##### fractions in the impregnating solution, the carbon material was
##### characterized by a large speci ﬁ c surface and porosity of the
##### microtubes, and the sorption of CO 2 increased with the increase in
##### the amount of PEI. Thus, a CO 2 uptake maximum value of

##### polarization and charge transfer processes governing the adsorp-
##### tion of CO 2 on the Ca-coated B 40 . In this way, each coated Ca atom
##### could adsorb up to four CO 2 molecules with an average adsorption
##### energy of 0.54 eV, which is within the range proposed for an ideal
##### CO 2 adsorbent. Furthermore, because to the considerable difference
##### in adsorption energy between CO 2 and H 2 , CH 4 , or N 2 , Ca-coated B 40
##### has proven to be effective in separating CO 2 from CH 4 /H 2 in natural
##### gas or from N 2 in ﬂ ue gas mixture (high selectivity towards CO 2 ).
##### DFT approach was also implemented in research regarding electric
##### ﬁ eld in CO 2 adsorption, where it consisted in achieving a speci ﬁ c
##### process mechanism in order to facilitate the uptake and regener-
##### ation of CO 2 capture material. Khan et al. [ 295 ] used an electric ﬁ eld
##### to study the behavior of carbon dioxide storage by phosphorus-
##### doped fullerene (P-doped C60-fullerene). They demonstrated that
##### CO 2 is physisorbed without the application of an electric ﬁ eld by
##### using the predicted adsorption energy. However, when it is
##### employed, it induced a change from physical to chemisorption of

##### molecules. One of the newest directions of research on fullerene as
##### adsorbents is the simultaneous sorption and reduction of CO 2 to
##### compounds that can be reused in industry (MOFs materials are
##### applied in a similar strategy). Qu et al. [ 293 ] sought to produce
##### photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction with high ef ﬁ ciency and selec-
##### tivity, which is important from both an energy and environmental
##### standpoint. ##### They ##### discovered ##### through ##### comprehensive ##### density
##### functional theory calculations that fullerene B 80 is an excellent
##### metal-free photocatalyst for CO 2 reduction to HCOOH (the activa-
##### tion and reduction mechanisms have been thoroughly investi-
##### gated). Formic acid, which is frequently used in organic synthesis,
##### beekeeping, and as a strong fungicidal preservative, can be reused
##### in this manner. Their work provided signi ﬁ cant insight into
##### adsorption of CO 2 and its possible reduction products on B 80 .
##### Further, the adsorption behavior of the calcium coated fullerene
##### B 40 by DFT method was studied by Esra ﬁ li et al. [ 292 ]. The Ca atom
##### has been discovered to be able to stably adsorb CO 2 molecules, with

##### carbon dioxide as a stronger chemical bond is formed between the
##### P atom and the CO 2 molecule. Consequently, by eliminating the
##### electric ﬁ eld, the adsorbent may be easily regenerated for reuse.
##### Moreover, P-doped fullerene has been discovered to be an excellent
##### adsorbent for CO 2 removal from a N 2 /CO 2 mixture. Khan et al. [ 294 ]
##### conducted the same research for P-decorated C 24 N 24 fullerene for
##### selective separation of CO 2 from N 2 /CO 2 mixture in the presence of
##### an electric ﬁ eld. The estimated geometric parameters revealed that
##### under the electric ﬁ eld, bond lengths and angles (O ¼ C ¼ O)
##### (O ¼ C ¼ O) are vastly reduced, converting physisorption to chemi-
##### sorption by raising the electric ﬁ eld. This research discovered that
##### P-decorated C 24 N 24 was a selective adsorbent and can aid in the
##### development of a controlled, and regenerable sorption for the CO 2
##### separation from a gas mixture in the presence of an electric ﬁ eld.

##### compared to the pristine material. Conversely, the samples with 10
##### and 50 wt% of TEPA shown worse performance in terms of CO 2
##### uptake. In this particular scenario, it was observed that an optimal
##### quantity of TEPA loading resulted in an enhanced CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity. However, excessive TEPA loading yielded a contrary
##### outcome, mostly owing to the decrease in the speci ﬁ c surface area
##### of the adsorbent and the reduced accessibility of the amine groups.
##### It is noteworthy that research has also been undertaken on the
##### modi ﬁ cation of the graphite surface using other chemical com-
##### pounds than amines as an alternative. Espinosa-Jim  ##### enez and
##### Domínguez [ 309 ] used an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sul-
##### fate to promote CO 2 adsorption on a graphite surface. The results
##### showed that the addition of surfactants increased con ﬁ nement of
##### CO 2 and the amount of gas retention on adsorbent. Other studies
##### also concern an investigation of sulfur doping effects and humidity
##### in ﬂ uence on the adsorption performance of graphite. Li et al. [ 310 ]
##### demonstrated ##### that ##### sulfur ##### doping ##### signi ﬁ cantly ##### increased ##### the
##### adsorption of pure CO 2 (graphite split graphite pore showed a
##### 39.85% growth in the adsorption capacity by the impregnation with
##### 33.12% sulfur at 27   C and 1 bar). Signi ﬁ cantly, it was observed that
##### split graphite pores demonstrated a notably greater CO 2 uptake
##### compared to sorbents without sulfur admixture, particularly in the
##### presence of water.
##### As previously mentioned, graphite oxides have been utilized in
##### the synthesis of composites, especially with MOFs. Policicchio et al.
##### [ 307 ] studied CO 2 adsorption on the parent MOFs and their com-
##### posites with graphite oxide and amine-based versions. The com-
##### posite of metal-organic frameworks and amine-based graphite
##### oxide with the highest content of nitrogen, showed the best per-
##### formance, in terms of both adsorption capacity and process
##### reversibility. The CO 2 capacity on this material reached 4.65 and
##### 7.27 mmol/g at 25 and 4   C at 0.1 MPa, which is competitive with
##### many best performing adsorbents addressed in the literature. In the
##### case of promising strategy for designing and fabricating composites
##### using copper-based MOF, Zhao et al. [ 308 ] examined graphite oxide
##### modi ﬁ ed with urea. The composite with the highest nitrogen
##### content exhibited an excellent CO 2 uptake (4.23 mmol/g) at 25   C.
##### The results indicated that CO 2 was mainly physisorbed on the
##### composites under dry conditions and the primary adsorption sites
##### were the open Cu centers. Then the small micropores on the
##### interface between MOF units and the modi ﬁ ed graphene layers,
##### were occupied by the adsorbate molecules. The analysis of the
##### adsorption heats suggested that the unsaturated copper sites were
##### stronger adsorption centers than the small micropores and the
##### interactions between copper and CO 2 were highly speci ﬁ c. In
##### addition, a prominent research direction in composite synthesis is
##### the application of graphite electrode waste together with cerium
##### oxide or iron oxide as adsorbents. These materials exhibit stability
##### and selectivity towards carbon dioxide, hence minimizing the
##### negative impacts on the environment [ 311 , 312 ].

##### Table 10 summarizes the modi ﬁ cation strategies employed to
##### improve CO 2 uptake and textural properties of graphite-based ad-
##### sorbents. So far, there has been no review closely related to
##### graphite, fullerene, the same as for carbon nanotubes. Therefore, a
##### critical review of the literature is recommended, which would
##### contribute to the organization of current knowledge on a laboratory
##### scale to facilitate the technological maturity of these carbon-based
##### materials.

##### 3.2.6. Graphene-based adsorbents
##### Graphene is a carbon allotrope in the form of a single-layer two-
##### dimensional honeycomb lattice (a 2D structure composed of car-
##### bon atoms connected in hexagons with sp 2  hybridization) [ 315 ]. In
##### the pursuit for a highly ef ﬁ cient sorption materials, graphene-
##### based ##### adsorbents ##### have ##### been ##### discovered ##### to ##### offer ##### amazing

##### 3.2.5. Graphite-based adsorbents
##### Graphite in light of its internal structure, properties similar to
##### those of carbonaceous adsorbents, and the economic advantage of
##### being low cost is also considered a unique material for CO 2 capture
##### [ 296 ]. Its structure is characterized by a multilayer arrangement
##### whereby carbon atoms exhibit sp 2  hybridization and occur in the
##### con ﬁ guration of closed six-membered rings [ 297 ]. These rings are
##### composed of graphene layers that form a complex spatial structure
##### connected by relatively weak intermolecular interactions known as
##### van der Waals forces. The strength of these forces may be precisely
##### represented by appropriate modeling techniques ( Fig. 16 ). There-
##### fore, the storage of gas molecules between the graphene layers is
##### possible by adjusting their mutual distances. However, graphite has
##### a weak af ﬁ nity towards CO 2 and a low surface area, limiting its CO 2
##### adsorption capacity [ 298 ].
##### The formation of new graphite structures is one of method to
##### overcome these limitations, apart from graphite exfoliation (con-
##### version to graphene oxide), chemical/physical activation, surface
##### functionalization, or composites synthesis ( Fig. 17 ). Several exam-
##### ples of them have been reported in the literature, e.g., graphite
##### nano ﬁ bers (Yuan et al. [ 299 ] studied the effect of KOH activation on
##### its surface), graphite nanoplatelets (Mishra et al. [ 300 ] proved that
##### this particular structure has the potential as an effective CO 2 cap-

##### thermal power plants, or the cement industry sector).
##### The most commonly form of graphite utilized in CO 2 adsorption
##### is graphite oxide, which is a product by applying the Hummer
##### method [ 301 ]. This approach introduces oxygen-containing func-

##### thesized several types of adsorbents, including amine-based ad-
##### sorbents [ 302 e 305 ] and hybrid materials [ 306 e 308 ], by employing
##### graphite oxide as an initial component. Shin et al. [ 302 ] developed
##### CO 2 adsorbents based on graphite oxide modi ﬁ ed with poly-
##### ethyleneimine. The study showed that the CO 2 adsorption capacity
##### and ##### CO 2 /N 2 ##### selectivity ##### increased ##### with ##### increasing ##### poly-

##### graphite oxide. The results obtained indicated that the maximum
##### CO 2 uptake and selectivity were 0.75 mmol/g and 37.13, respec-
##### tively, with a polyethyleneimine content of 60% by weight. Hong
##### et al. [ 305 ] modi ﬁ ed the graphite oxide with 3-aminopropyl-trie-
##### thoxysilane, which ensured the enhancement of the af ﬁ nity for CO 2

##### However, because of the highly strong intermolecular interac-
##### tion and the limited number of functional groups, pristine gra-
##### phene has poor dispersibility and compatibility [ 321 ]. In this sense,
##### graphene oxide (GO), an alternative form of graphene, exhibits
##### remarkable characteristics attributed to the abundance of hydro-
##### philic oxygenated functional groups. These groups offer numerous
##### active sites for the joining of additional functional groups or mol-
##### ecules, thereby enabling functionalization through both covalent
##### and non-covalent bonding mechanisms [ 322 , 323 ]. In addition to
##### that, the adaptability of surface modi ﬁ cation allows the use of
##### graphene-based materials for CO 2 capture [ 324 ]. Another form of
##### graphene used in CO 2 adsorption application, inter alia, for the
##### synthesis of composites, is reduced graphene oxide (rGO). rGO is
##### produced by the chemical or thermal reduction of graphene oxide.
##### It is considered to possess a structure that is between that of a
##### graphene sheet and highly oxidized graphene oxide [ 325 ]. The
##### three structures of graphene are schematically shown in Fig. 18 .
##### Currently, research on graphene as a CO 2 capture material
##### concerns similar modi ﬁ cations as in the case of graphite, such as
##### synthesis ##### of ##### hybrid ##### materials/composites ##### (MOFs ##### [ 326 e 328 ],
##### carbon-based materials [ 329 ], polymers [ 330 , 331 ], incorporation of
##### metal oxides [ 332 , 333 ], clays [ 334 ]), creating new material struc-
##### tures based on graphene (aerogels [ 335 ], cryogels [ 336 , 337 ]), and
##### treatment methods related to the improvement of the surface
##### morphology (oxidation [ 338 ], physical and chemical activation
##### [ 339 e 341 ]) ( Fig. 19 ). Xia et al. [ 339 ] tuned the pore structure and
##### surface chemistry of porous graphene materials (PGMs) for CO 2
##### capture, which was achieved by activating CO 2 and KOH in ther-
##### mally exfoliated graphite oxide. CO 2 -activated PGMs (CPGM) had a
##### three-dimensional morphology with a hierarchical pore structure,
##### while ##### KOH-activated ##### PGMs ##### (KPGM) ##### had ##### a ##### two-dimensional
##### morphology with large number of micropores and small meso-
##### pores. Speci ﬁ cally, CPGM exhibited a substantial presence of
##### quinone and carbonyl functional groups, while KPGM demon-
##### strated a signi ﬁ cant concentration of hydroxyl groups. These dis-
##### tinctions in surface chemistry were con ﬁ rmed through pore
##### structure analysis and gas adsorption experiments. Additionally,
##### the CO 2 adsorption by PGM was in ﬂ uenced by both the pore
##### structure and the surface chemistry. At 0   C and 1 bar, the highest
##### adsorption value reached 4.06 mmol/g.
##### Another popular modi ﬁ cation of graphene-based adsorbents is
##### attaching organic functional groups to the graphene surface. Ni-
##### trogen doping [ 342 e 344 ] has been found to be a promising strat-
##### egy to improve CO 2 adsorption capability. The developed materials
##### were characterized by excellent stability and recyclability, high
##### selectivity of CO 2 in relation to N 2 , suitable heat of adsorption, high
##### dynamic adsorption, as well as fast CO 2 adsorption kinetics. As a
##### result of their exceptional characteristic, GO has been fully exploi-
##### ted as a suitable framework for the fabrication of an amine-
##### functionalized adsorbents for selective CO 2 capture. Moreover,
##### there are many advantages associated with this speci ﬁ c research
##### path, which are as follows: (1) reduced energy consumption during
##### regeneration, (2) no corrosion susceptibility of instruments, (3) low
##### creation of harmful byproducts due to amine groups incorporated
##### in the solid matrix. Hosseini et al. [ 342 ] modi ﬁ ed the surfaces of
##### graphene oxide with 3 different amines, including triethylenetetr-
##### amine (TETA), pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) and meta -phenyl-
##### enediamine (MPD). At 298 K and 1 bar, CO 2 adsorption improved
##### dramatically from 0.39 mmol/g for graphene oxide (GO) to 0.61,
##### 0.74, and 0.91 mmol/g for GO-PEHA, GO-TETA, and GO-MPD sam-
##### ples, respectively. Furthermore, based on the ideal adsorbed solu-
##### tion ##### theory ##### (IAST), ##### the ##### predicted ##### CO 2 /N 2 ##### selectivity ##### of ##### the
##### investigated solid sorbents revealed an outstanding value, partic-
##### ularly for the GO/MPD, reaching around 21.21 under ambient

##### quently, the samples were exposed to a thermal shock treatment,
##### which aimed to enhance the structural features of the adsorbent.
##### The results demonstrated that thermal expansion of the GO pre-

##### demonstrated good CO 2 adsorption, with 2.40 and 3.24 mmol/g at
##### 25 and 0   C, respectively. Furthermore, investigations have shown
##### that under ambient conditions, both narrow microporosity and N-

##### In summary, this type of CO 2 capture materials must exhibit a
##### range of desired properties in order to be considered economically
##### viable and ecologically sustainable for sorption applications. These
##### include a substantial surface area and pore volume, the presence of
##### a porous structure (speci ﬁ cally microporosity), and the effective
##### modi ﬁ cation of surface chemistry through the incorporation of
##### functional groups or heteroatoms. Lately, Ruhaimi et al. [ 346 ] sys-
##### tematically provided a comprehensive overview of the most recent
##### scienti ﬁ c research concerning the utilization of graphene-based
##### adsorbents in CO 2 adsorption technologies, as well as a discussion
##### of that investigation. The authors highlighted several signi ﬁ cant
##### challenges that must be addressed in order to fully harness the
##### promise of graphene-based adsorbents in the present moment.
##### First, most of the current fabrication techniques, apparatus,
##### and supplies are both expensive and time consuming, which limits
##### their usefulness in the industrial sector. The signi ﬁ cance of
##### manufacturing costs in the context of large CO 2 capture systems
##### cannot be overstated. Consequently, it is imperative to explore
##### alternative recyclable waste residues for the purpose of processing

##### and functionalizing carbon-based adsorbents, with the aim of
##### fostering a bene ﬁ cial in ﬂ uence on the circular economy. Additional
##### barriers that should be taken into consideration refer to the de-
##### mand for more extensive research and an in-depth analysis of the
##### CO 2 adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, it is crucial to place
##### greater emphasis on conducting CO 2 sorption tests in both wet and
##### dry environments to enhance the diffusion of CO 2 molecules into
##### the porous structure of the material. Additionally, there is a ne-
##### cessity for further advancement in hybrid materials incorporating
##### graphene-based adsorbents to enhance CO 2 uptake, while also
##### considering other criteria for the selection and optimization of CO 2
##### capture materials.
##### The previously published review in 2015 by Balasubramanian
##### and Chowdhury [ 347 ] also presented an in-depth evaluation of the
##### emerging ﬁ eld of graphene-based adsorbents, highlighting notable
##### areas for future research. Its primary objective was to compile the
##### latest advancements in this rapidly evolving ﬁ eld. In particular, the
##### authors highlighted the importance of de ﬁ ning the work path
##### development on a laboratory scale and their practical transfer to a
##### commercial application. Due to this, there is an unavoidable need
##### for an expansive research endeavor that is both multidisciplinary
##### and interconnected. Further future perspectives and recommen-
##### dations have been proposed in relation to the measurement of CO 2
##### uptake on a volumetric basis, assessment of working capacity,

##### 3.3. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)









##### Organic-inorganic hybrid porous materials, such as metal-
##### organic frameworks, are solid CO 2 adsorbents with bene ﬁ ts
##### including excellent thermodynamic stability, customizable chemi-
##### cal functionality, extra high porosity, easily programmable pore
##### characteristics, high purity, well-de ﬁ ned crystallographic geo-
##### metric properties, and large-scale production capability, among
##### other materials [ 352 e 354 ]. Generally, MOFs are composed of
##### metal-containing nodes that are connected together by organic
##### linking groups (organic ligand bridges) principally through strong
##### covalent bonds (coordination bonds) that form a one-, two- or
##### three-dimensional coordination network [ 355 e 357 ]. MOFs can be
##### classi ﬁ ed into different groups based on their structural properties,
##### such as rigid MOFs, dynamic/ ﬂ exible MOFs, surface functionalized
##### MOFs, open metal sites MOFs, Lewis basic sites MOFs, both open
##### metal and Lewis basic sites MOFs, microporous MOFs, post-
##### synthetically modi ﬁ ed MOFs, and MOF composites [ 356 ]. Addi-
##### tionally, a combination of the above groups can be distinguished,
##### i.e., MOFs with micropores and a functionalized surface, or micro-
##### pores and open metal sites. The generic classi ﬁ cation is shown in
##### Fig. 20 .
##### To date, a signi ﬁ cant number of publications have been dedi-
##### cated to the improvement of CO 2 capture by MOFs. Modifying the
##### type and quantity of organic linkers or changing the connectivity of
##### metal ions (both of the two fundamental building components)
##### may be used to continuously improve a CO 2 adsorption perfor-
##### mance and quality of MOFs structures [ 358 , 359 ]. As a result, various
##### modi ﬁ cations of MOFs synthesis and their in ﬂ uence on the ef ﬁ -
##### ciency of carbon dioxide uptake were investigated, including the
##### selection of organic linker [ 360 ], activating and removing the sol-
##### vent molecule [ 361 ], and altering the open metal sites and Lewis
##### basic sites [ 362 , 363 ]. Therefore, those materials possess a high
##### degree of simplicity in terms of their production and adaptability
##### for CO 2 capture application. The schematic illustration of CO 2
##### storage mechanism in MOFs structure is given in Fig. 21 By
##### comparing metal-organic frameworks with other porous materials
##### like zeolites and activated carbons, it becomes transparent that
##### MOFs exhibit the ability to readily optimize their porosity, surface
##### characteristics, and other properties. This versatility renders them
##### highly suitable for a diverse range of speci ﬁ c and precise applica-
##### tions as solid material for CO 2 adsorption [ 364 ]. Nevertheless, the
##### main challenge in achieving a high degree of crystallinity in the
##### synthesis of MOFs lies in the optimization of multiple reaction
##### parameters. These parameters include the concentration of re-
##### actants, the ratio of metal to ligand, the concentration of co-
##### solvents, the pH of the solution, as well as the temperature and
##### time of the reaction [ 356 , 365 ].
##### The amount of CO 2 captured by porous MOF materials is
##### dependent on a number of parameters, including adsorption ca-
##### pacity, surface morphology, selectivity, and the amount of energy
##### used during adsorption. Generally, the robust ability of MOFs to
##### capture CO 2 can be attributed to their unique chemical and
##### physical properties of frameworks, which are appropriately
##### changed and adjusted to increase the interaction forces between
##### the material surface and the CO 2 molecules [ 357 ]. These dis-
##### tinguishing characteristics primarily include pore size, porosity,
##### speci ﬁ c surface area, unsaturated or open metal sites, and inte-
##### gration of polar functional groups into the pore channels ( e NH 2 ,
##### e OH, e NO 2 , and e COOH) [ 366 , 367 ]. In order to modify these
##### parameters, extensive research has been performed in recent
##### decades. As an instance, Furukawa et al. [ 366 ] developed ultrahigh
##### porosity in MOFs by synthesizing crystalline solids with extended
##### non-interpenetrating three-dimensional crystal structures sup-
##### ported well-de ﬁ ned pores. Series of MOFs showed exceptional

##### linkers may be selectively added to MOFs, the pores within these
##### materials can be tuned more precisely than standard porous zeo-
##### lites. Wu et al. [ 372 ] presented ﬂ exible MMOFs as remarkable
##### adsorbent with high CO 2 selectivity of over other gaseous mole-
##### cules at relative low pressure and high temperature, which are
##### comparable to those present in ﬂ ue gas mixtures.
##### However, developing MMOFs with exceptionally high CO 2 cap-
##### ture ##### capacity ##### and ##### gas ##### selectivity ##### while ##### still ##### simultaneously
##### requiring low regeneration energy, remains a formidable obstacle
##### to overcome. Recently, Wen et al. [ 373 ] designed and synthesized a
##### MMOF with suitable pore size and dual functionalities. That ma-
##### terial displayed excellent CO 2 capture capacity (3.56 mmol/g at
##### 0.15 bar and 23   C) as well as strong CO 2 /N 2 selectivity (600), both
##### of these values were considerably higher than those observed in
##### most other MMOFs previously reported. The research ﬁ ndings
##### further indicated that the outstanding CO 2 uptake at low pressure
##### and mild heat of CO 2 adsorption may be related to the appropriate
##### pore size and dual functionalities, which not only interact with CO 2
##### molecules but also enable them to dense pack inside the
##### framework. Other studies on MMOFs concern pore environment
##### modi ﬁ cations to enhance CO 2 adsorption. Fan et al. [ 374 ] alter
##### multifunctional ligands with e F, e Cl, e NH 2 , e CH3, e OCH 3 , and
##### organic secondary building units with bipy-N ligands (dimethyl-
##### amine, pyridine, 4-aminopyridine, and isonicotinic acid) based on

##### porosities and CO 2 uptake with the maximum BET surface area
##### reaching of almost 6240 m 2 /g. Further, Farha et al. [ 367 ] focused
##### on combining MOFs featuring ultrahigh surface via de novo
##### approach entailing computational design and simulations before
##### experimentation. The obtained adsorbent had a high BET surface
##### (6143 m 2 /g) with high CO 2 storage capacity.
##### Currently, R & D projects on MOFs mainly focus on investigating
##### the impact of process conditions and ﬂ ue gas composition on CO 2
##### adsorption. This research mainly concentrates on the in ﬂ uence of
##### moisture, as well as pollutants. Other areas of interest include
##### altering and ﬁ xing pore shape and size, modifying metal sites and
##### Lewis basic bases, doping with metal ions, creating novel struc-
##### tures, optimizing regeneration and recycling procedures, exploring
##### various methods of functionalizing the pore surfaces of MOFs, and
##### synthesizing MOF composites ( Fig. 22 ) [ 296 , 355 , 356 ]. The main
##### objective of the above modi ﬁ cations is to further enhance the CO 2
##### uptake, selectivity towards CO 2 , and stability of the framework it-
##### self, according to the researchers [ 368 ]. Therefore, the majority of
##### studies concern the evaluation of CO 2 adsorption capacity by
##### determining the adsorption equilibrium [ 369 ].
##### A large number of microporous metal e organic frameworks
##### (MMOFs) have been developed as CO 2 capture materials. Chen et al.
##### [ 370 , 371 ] emphasized that the tuning of micropores inside MOFs is
##### critical for their application in the separation of small molecules.
##### Since metal-containing secondary building units and organic

##### microporous Ni-MOFs. Fluorine modi ﬁ ed MOFs showed the highest
##### CO 2 uptake of 3.81 mmol/g at 0   C and 1 atm. The conclusive
##### ﬁ ndings indicated successful synthesis of innovative porous ma-
##### terials that offer signi ﬁ cant ef ﬁ cacy as CO 2 adsorbent, hence
##### contributing to the development of a systematic approach for
##### enhancing gas adsorption and separation abilities.
##### Several research have been conducted to investigate the rational
##### modi ﬁ cation of open metal sites and Lewis nitrogen sites, aiming to
##### enhance the CO 2 sorption performance. These studies provide vital
##### insights for the design and synthesis of novel materials in the ﬁ eld
##### of MOFs. Song et al. [ 375 ] conceived and produced three diisoph-
##### thalate organic ligands containing nitrogen and utilized them to
##### synthesize ##### three ##### isostructural ##### NbO-type ##### MOFs ##### with ##### varying
##### numbers and orientations of nitrogen sites. The results of the
##### investigation established that the CO 2 adsorption characteristics of
##### MOFs are in ﬂ uenced not only by the amount of Lewis basic nitrogen
##### sites but also by their accessibility. Additionally, the introduction of
##### functional groups does not have a restricted impact on improving
##### CO 2 uptake.
##### Accordingly, ligand functionalization or post-synthetic modi ﬁ -
##### cation has been explored by many researchers. Xu et al. [ 376 ]
##### developed two N-oxide functionalized linear diisophthalate ligands
##### and used them to create their corresponding NbO-type MOFs under
##### acceptable solvothermal conditions. Their CO 2 adsorption capac-

##### Recently, the ordered mesoporous silica has also been selected
##### for use in the fabrication of MOF-based composite materials, ac-
##### cording to the researchers [ 380 e 383 ]. The introduction of ordered
##### mesoporous structure, in addition to providing functional attri-
##### butes that are comparable to those of carbon-based materials, also
##### offers the reduction of mass transfer resistance of guest molecules
##### and boosts the diffusion ef ﬁ ciency [ 379 ]. Chen et al. [ 380 ]
##### attempted to create hybrid composites based on mesoporous silica
##### and MOFs that exhibited both high CO 2 adsorption capacity and
##### rapid adsorption kinetics. The composite was constituted of MIL-
##### 101(Cr) and mesoporous silica through an in-situ hydrothermal
##### method. The synthesis led to reduced particle size, enhanced
##### micropore volume, and increased speci ﬁ c surface area of the
##### composite, resulting in a considerable improvement in its CO 2
##### uptake (2.09 mmol/g at 0   C and 1 bar), about 79% higher than that
##### of parent MOF. Further, the application of MCM-41 contributed to a
##### decrease in the mass transfer resistance and facilitated the CO 2
##### diffusion. Consequently, there was an apparent reduction in
##### the time required to achieve adsorption equilibrium and an in-
##### crease in the adsorption rate. Moreover, the synergistic impact of
##### mesoporous silica and MOFs strengthened the interactions be-
##### tween CO 2 molecules and the composite, as indicated by the isos-
##### teric heats of CO 2 adsorption and desorption activation energy.
##### Further, the chemical composition of the ﬂ ue gases, which are
##### separated for the purpose of carbon dioxide capture, is a crucial
##### factor to consider in relation to MOFs. Especially, the presence of
##### moisture can substantially impact on the CO 2 adsorption capacity of
##### MOFs. Llewellyn et al. [ 384 ] highlighted the difference in the
##### adsorption behavior between the polar and nonpolar nature of the
##### molecules that are being adsorbed on MOFs. In general, different
##### molecules with various degrees of polarity need to be investigated

##### effectiveness ##### for ##### NbO-type ##### MOF ##### counterparts. ##### Furthermore,
##### structure e property relationship investigations demonstrated that
##### the N-oxide functionality is highly critical for increasing CO 2
##### adsorption ef ﬁ ciency.
##### As previously stated, metal-organic frameworks are typically
##### utilized together with other materials to form composite struc-
##### tures. Typically, the production of these MOF-based composites
##### requires the dissolution of the raw components or as-processed
##### materials in the precursor solutions of MOFs prior to initiating
##### the reactions. As a consequence of the synergistic effects, the
##### resulting ##### multi-component ##### composites ##### not ##### only ##### exhibit ##### the
##### inherent strength of the original materials, but also possess unique
##### physicochemical characteristics and functional properties. In recent
##### years, carbon-based materials have been extensively used to
##### fabricate such composites. The addition of these components has
##### the potential to regulate particle sizes and drive the formation of
##### MOF crystals in a certain direction, hence leading to improved
##### adsorption capacity [ 377 ]. Kayal and Chakraborty [ 378 ] designed
##### and developed carbon-based MOF composite, which was synthe-
##### sized by in situ incorporation of activated carbon powder (type
##### Maxsorb-III) in MOF (MIL-101(Cr)). In comparison to the parent
##### MOF, it was seen that the composite exhibited greater CO 2
##### adsorption capacity. Speci ﬁ cally, the composite demonstrated a 10%
##### and 15% increase in CO 2 uptake on a volumetric and gravimetric
##### basis, respectively. Qian et al. [ 379 ] aimed to improve the structural
##### features of hierarchical porous carbon monolith (HCM) by incor-
##### porating the advantages of metal e organic frameworks (Cu 3 (BTC) 2 )
##### to optimize the CO 2 capture on a volumetric basis. The obtained
##### composite was characterized by a signi ﬁ cant CO 2 adsorption ca-
##### pacity value, notable CO 2 -over-N 2 selectivity and a good regener-
##### ation capability.

##### to productively recover CO 2 in mixed-gas streams, particularly
##### those with a substantial water content. Yu and Balbuena [ 385 ]
##### evaluated water effects on post-combustion CO 2 capture in MOFs
##### by using a combination of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and
##### DFT simulations. Their ﬁ ndings indicated that the presence of water
##### molecules linked to coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUMs)
##### reduces the CO 2 adsorption capacity of MOFs. This resulted from a
##### decrease in the binding energy between CO 2 and the water-
##### coordinated MOFs. Simultaneously, it was revealed that the CUMs
##### in MOFs are critical for their CO 2 uptake in realistic streams that
##### incorporate water and other contaminants. Nevertheless, these
##### data are especially noteworthy in light of the recovery of carbon
##### dioxide in multicomponent gas mixtures.
##### In summary, MOFs are potentially extremely interesting inno-
##### vation for large-scale commercialization of CO 2 adsorbent mate-
##### rials. Unfortunately, there are several drawbacks associated with
##### MOFs that need to be addressed in order to facilitate their scal-
##### ability and enhance technological maturity. Aniruddha et al. [ 386 ]
##### in their review on utilization of MOFs in CO 2 capture, highlighted
##### several important aspects, including dif ﬁ culty in large-scale syn-
##### thesis (majority of synthesis techniques are suitable for small-scale
##### and laboratory experiments), lack of thermal stability (enhancing it
##### through manipulation of MOFs morphology is crucial), excessive
##### attraction of moisture (total disintegration of the crystalline
##### structure), further study to increase the desorption temperature
##### and the spontaneity of the CO 2 adsorption, or development of pa-
##### rameters for screening MOFs. The other barriers are related to high
##### cost on an industrial scale, low selectivity of CO 2 /N 2 , poor chemical,
##### mechanical, and hydrothermal stability, These challenges still
##### persist ##### for ##### their ##### application ##### under ##### humid ##### conditions ##### [ 387 ].
##### Furthermore, to assess their virtues and demerits, metrics such as
##### cyclic stability, regenerability, and kinetics must be evaluated under
##### real/harsh operating conditions. Therefore, as stated by Youmas
##### et al. [ 355 ], integrating the economics of the manufacturing process
##### with the molecular-level properties of MOFs is essential path to
##### create materials that are technically viable as well as commercially
##### successful.

##### Table 12 provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of

##### various metal-organic frameworks.

##### 3.4. Polymers

##### which stand as crystalline materials featuring ordered structures
##### formed under thermodynamic control, all other POPs show an
##### amorphous nature [ 417 , 418 ].
##### Until recently, considerable endeavors have been dedicated to
##### formulating and creating high-performance POPs adsorbents,
##### yielding promising outcomes. According to the latest reviews
##### published between 2017 and 2022 by Mohamed et al. [ 416 ], Gao
##### et al. [ 421 ], Bhanja et al. [ 422 ], and Wang et al. [ 423 ], the key
##### research ﬁ elds for improving the CO 2 capture properties of POPs
##### can be characterized as follows: (1) increasing the CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity of materials, (2) enhancing CO 2 /N 2 selectivity, and (3)
##### considerations the real application conditions. The all authors
##### highlighted that mainly, due to the micropore ﬁ lling process, large
##### speci ﬁ c surface areas [ 424 , 425 ] and appropriate micropore sizes
##### [ 426 , 427 ] are considered as in ﬂ uential factors with regard to CO 2
##### uptake and selectivity. Alternatively, the metal sites [ 428 , 429 ] and
##### the morphology of POPs have been reported to be important de-
##### terminants that impact CO 2 storage process. Therefore, some as-
##### pects of the above properties should be investigated further. The
##### creation of 3D POPs with a large surface is one of them [ 426 ]. This
##### strategy could allow modi ﬁ cation of POPs to occur while still
##### retaining a part of the BET surface area. Secondly, it's advisable to
##### employ post-synthesis conditions that are milder and more ef ﬁ -
##### cient. This approach can incorporate the functional moiety while
##### preserving the porous structure of POPs. Furthermore, enhancing
##### the af ﬁ nity between CO 2 and the material surface can be achieved
##### through the introduction of heteroatoms (N, O, S, F) or the inte-
##### gration of functional groups ( e NH 2 , e OH) within POPs. This can be
##### realized by using diverse monomers or implementing post-
##### functionalization techniques. Unfortunately, the insertion of func-

##### of POPs. This could occur due to the added volume of functional
##### groups obstructing the available pore space or leading to an in-
##### crease in the density of porous polymers, among other possible
##### factors. Diverse strategies can be applied to address these chal-

##### expanding the speci ﬁ c surface area of polymers [ 416 , 421 e 423 ].
##### In the case of industrial application, the subsequent aspects

##### Porous organic polymers (POPs) constitute an emerging class of
##### porous materials, composed of lightweight components linked by
##### robust covalent bonds. They have showcased signi ﬁ cant potential
##### across various applications, including gas storage and separation
##### [ 409 , 410 ]. Several classes of POPs have been developed, including

##### frameworks (COFs), hyper-crosslinked polymers (HCPs), covalent
##### triazine frameworks (CTFs), porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs),
##### and polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), presented sche-
##### matically in Fig. 23 . In the context of widespread utilization for CO 2
##### capture, three fundamental groups of POPs can be highlighted, such
##### as CMPs, COFs, and HCPs.
##### POPs exhibit a combination of advantageous characteristics,
##### including low density, extensive surface areas, adjustable pore sizes
##### with numerous channels, and abundant active sites available for
##### chemical reactions. They also offer easily customizable function-
##### ality, exceptional physicochemical stability, and a wide array of
##### design options and synthetic approaches ( Fig. 24 ). Hence, POPs
##### have arisen as highly promising CO 2 capture materials [ 411 e 416 ].
##### Typically, diverse network reactions are employed in the prepara-

##### remains an ongoing obstacle in synthetic chemistry because of the
##### complicated creation process of the porous morphology. Newly, Liu
##### et al. [ 444 ] improved CO 2 adsorption capacity by developing a
##### simple post-knitting process to enhance the surface area. The ob-
##### tained CMPs had a high Brunauer e Emmett e Teller surface area and
##### total pore volume up to 2267 m 2 /g and 3.27 cm 3 /g, respectively,
##### which was 2.3 and 8.8 times greater than that of the precursors.
##### These CMPs demonstrated signi ﬁ cant CO 2 uptake improvements,
##### achieving 3.98 mmol/g at 1 bar and 0   C. Moreover, it has been
##### reported that non-functionalized microporous organic polymers
##### (MOPs) typically exhibit a signi ﬁ cantly low CO 2 uptake at ambient
##### temperatures and pressures. This is due to their low CO 2 adsorption
##### enthalpies resulting from the absence of robust CO 2 binding sites.
##### To accomplish high-performance CO 2 capture, novel MOPs with
##### rationally modi ﬁ ed skeletons and varied functionalities are desir-
##### able. Zhang et al. [ 445 ] used sulfone and hydroxyl groups as func-
##### tionalities in a synthesis of biofunctionalized CMPs via palladium-
##### catalyzed Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling reaction. The syn-
##### thesized polymers showed a signi ﬁ cant BET surface area up to
##### 1470 m 2 /g, along with a carbon dioxide uptake of 2.77 mmol/g at
##### 0   C and 1.13 bar. Likewise, Wang et al. [ 446 ] proposed to use
##### thiophene as a base for two novel CMPs. The obtained adsorbents
##### displayed good physicochemical stability and outstanding CO 2
##### adsorption capacity (14.73 mmol/g at 50 bar and 44.85   C).

##### groups [ 437 e 440 ], introduction of heteroatoms into the skeleton
##### [ 441 , 442 ], and metal functionalization [ 413 ]. Due to that, CMPs can
##### be customized for utilization across a diverse spectrum of CO 2
##### capture applications, owing to the wide range of variability in the
##### selection and design of components, as well as the control over
##### other characteristics. Jiang et al. [ 443 ] showed that, the surface area
##### and pore size can be regulated by the monomer structure of the
##### network. In addition, these features may be ﬁ ne-tuned in a
##### continuous way by copolymerization of monomers with varying

##### Gao et al. [ 421 ] in their review highlighted that one of the most

##### frameworks are synthesized based on the principles of reticular
##### chemistry, where organic building blocks with pre-designed ge-
##### ometries and radicals are connected through the formation of co-
##### valent bonds to produce extended networks [ 451 ]. Fine regulation
##### pore sizes, shapes with speci ﬁ c distribution, alongside achieving
##### low density and precise control of skeleton structure, emerge as the
##### most attractive characteristics of COFs for CO 2 adsorption. This
##### distinction is particularly apparent when comparing COFs with
##### crystalline structures to their amorphous counterparts [ 452 ].
##### Recent ﬁ ndings suggested that materials featuring pore sizes close
##### to the kinetic radius of CO 2 tend to exhibit notable CO 2 uptake
##### [ 423 ], emphasizing the effectiveness of COFs with precisely
##### controlled pore sizes as promising CO 2 capture materials [ 453 ].

##### Similar conclusions were drawn by Furukawa and Yaghi [ 454 ],
##### demonstrating that COFs hold an advantageous standing in com-
##### parison to common carbon-based materials, zeolites, and MOFs.
##### This positions COFs ﬁ rmly within the category of valuable porous
##### materials and highlights their ef ﬁ cacy as effective CO 2 adsorbents.
##### A signi ﬁ cant number of ongoing research concern the explora-
##### tion for innovative COFs through diverse different synthetic
##### methods, aiming to capture CO 2 from a variety of sources and
##### transform it to valuable products. These applications involve CO 2
##### ﬁ xation to epoxides for cyclic carbonate synthesis and CO 2 reduc-
##### tion to CO [ 455 ]. Additionally, it is very desirable to combine the
##### criteria for high crystallinity, robust stability, and increasing
##### porosity with the requirements for high speci ﬁ c surface area and
##### small pore size for gas storage. In consequences, the precise regu-
##### lation of control of internal pore structure becomes crucial for COFs.
##### Considering these trends, Tian et al. [ 456 ] managed to develop a
##### strategy ##### to ##### construct ##### heteropores ##### COFs. ##### These ##### COFs ##### with

##### heteropores possessed two kinds of micropores characterized by
##### varying shapes and sizes, with one being a quadrangle and the

##### tion capacities for CO 2 and H 2 , with CO 2 uptake reaching up to
##### 19.8 wt% (0  C, 1 bar), positioning them as one of the top-
##### performing COFs for CO 2 capture.
##### An alternative approach for developing COFs is the functional-
##### ization of pore surfaces, speci ﬁ cally through channel wall func-
##### tionalization. This can be achieved by incorporating chemical
##### moieties, such as polar functional groups [ 457 ], immobilizing ionic
##### liquids or introducing speci ﬁ c special active sites into polymer
##### networks [ 458 ], such as heteroatoms [ 459 ], charged units [ 460 ] and

##### with the ultimate goal of optimizing their ef ﬁ cacy as CO 2 capture
##### materials. Furthermore, considering the analysis of various reviews
##### about COFs, it is possible to provide supplementary objectives for
##### enhancing this category of POPs. Olajire et al. [ 463 ] used a wide
##### range of sources to present an in-depth look of potential research
##### paths for COFs. According to the author, research endeavors should
##### be concentrated on the following areas, such as the exploration of
##### novel synthetic methodologies, 3D COFs construction, improving
##### the synthesis parameters of COFs and scaling them for commercial
##### applications, constructing hybrid membranes based on COFs, and
##### conducting experiments on separation of CO 2 from other gases in
##### ﬂ ue gas streams. In addition, Gao et al. [ 421 ] highlighted an addi-
##### tional signi ﬁ cant challenge, which involves synthesizing COFs with
##### high CO 2 uptake under humid conditions.

##### Fig. 27 presents the current status of modi ﬁ cation strategies and

##### 3.4.1.3. Hyper-crosslinked ##### polymers ##### (HCPs). Hyper-crosslinked
##### polymers are commonly synthesized from a wide range of low-cost

##### more, it has been established as an ef ﬁ cient heterogeneous catalyst
##### for the transformation of CO 2 into high-value-added formamides
##### under ambient conditions.
##### Buyukcakir et al. [ 460 ] developed and synthesized the ﬁ rst
##### charged covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with temperature-

##### tion of ionic functional moieties. The ionic character of CTFs, in
##### addition to their large surface area, thermal and chemical dura-

##### due to the extra electrostatic interactions between CO 2 molecules
##### and charge centers of viologen units. The resulting CTFs showed
##### high BET surface area up to 1247 m 2 /g and CO 2 uptake approxi-
##### mately around 3.02 mmol/g at 1 bar and 0   C.
##### Liu et al. [ 462 ] constructed the triazine-based COF (highly

##### Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction, employed in the production of
##### HCPs, allows the attainment of desired properties without neces-
##### sitating the use of precious metal coupling catalysts [ 467 ]. More-
##### over, a variety of precursors has been used in the synthesis process
##### of HCPs. A noticeable trend is observed in repurposing waste ma-
##### terials [ 468 ], including biomass-based aromatic compounds [ 469 ].
##### That is closely related to the broad adaptability of monomers, and
##### the processability of their structures. For example, Fu et al. [ 468 ]
##### proposed a facile strategy for synthesizing HCPs using expanded
##### polystyrene foam. The HCPs that were produced exhibited high
##### speci ﬁ c surface areas and excellent thermal stability. At 0   C and
##### 1.13 bar, HCP demonstrated the maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity,
##### reaching 1.987 mmol/g, along with the highest adsorption selec-
##### tivity ratio (CO 2 over N 2 ) of 23.4. Additionally, Fayemiwo et al. [ 470 ]
##### used monomers for the environmentally friendly fabrication of
##### HCPs using hydrocarbons sourced from fossil fuels.
##### Compared to other types of microporous polymers, HCPs offer a
##### straightforward synthesis procedure, a diverse selection of mono-
##### mer sources, and a relatively inexpensive and widely accessible
##### catalyst [ 471 ]. One of the most signi ﬁ cant advantages of these
##### organic polymers for CO 2 capture is the substantial surface area
##### created through the interconnected aromatic structures. Among

##### other characteristics, HCPs exhibit robustness and scalability,
##### exceptional thermal stability, outstanding chemical resistance (e.g.,
##### to strong acids and bases), and exceptionally facile manufacturing
##### process on a large scale. Nevertheless, a signi ﬁ cant challenge
##### encountered by HCPs is associated with their molecular design-
##### based synthesis, requiring carefully control over pore structure
##### [ 421 ].
##### A considerable body of literature has focused on the exploration
##### of strategies to improve CO 2 capture by COFs. The conventional
##### approach adopted to enhance the CO 2 adsorption capacity of these
##### materials involves increasing the speci ﬁ c surface area and modi-
##### fying the pore size through various synthetic methods. In recent
##### years, studies have shown that HCPs containing active sites can
##### achieve higher CO 2 adsorption capacity while having a smaller
##### speci ﬁ c surface area compared to traditional HCPs. For this reason,
##### several endeavors have been undertaken with the aim of increasing
##### the CO 2 uptake and selectivity of HCPs by the introduction of polar
##### functional groups or heteroatoms (N, O, Si). Fayemiwo et al. [ 472 ]
##### synthesized a series of nitrogen-rich, hyper-crosslinked polymers
##### (HCP-MAAMs) through bulk co-polymerization. The polymers were
##### initially functionalized with amide groups and demonstrated a
##### remarkable CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 104 at ultra-low CO 2 partial

##### pressures. At 0   C, the maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity was
##### 1.56 mmol/g, while the corresponding isosteric heat of adsorption
##### ranged from 28 to 35 kJ/mol, respectively.
##### Another extensively reported nitrogen-containing functional
##### group used in HCP synthesis is carbazole [ 473 e 477 ]. Chang et al.
##### [ 475 ] created two distinct types of indolo[3,2-b] carbazole-based
##### building blocks, differing in the different number of reactive sites.
##### The synthesized nitrogen-rich polymers demonstrated a substan-
##### tial BET surface area of up to 1421 m 2 /g, coupled with a CO 2 uptake
##### of 3.58 mmol/g at 0   C and 1.13 bar. These values are comparable to
##### those seen in several other POPs, indicating their competitive na-
##### ture. Ramezanipour Penchah et al. [ 477 ] investigated the in ﬂ uence
##### of operating parameters (crosslinker ratio, synthesis time, and
##### catalyst type) on CO 2 adsorption capacity of carbazole-based HCP,
##### synthesized through a Friedel e Crafts reaction. At a temperature of
##### 25   C and a pressure of 5 bars, the CO 2 uptake reached its optimum
##### value of approximately 4.35 mmol/g.
##### HCPs can also serve as precursors for producing porous carbons.
##### The wide variety of aromatic compounds available as raw materials
##### makes it appealing to synthesize porous carbons from HCPs,
##### especially those that are highly porous or entirely microporous

##### Shao et al. [ 478 ] developed a series of NDPC with tunable porosity
##### and polarity derived from the N-containing HCPs, prepared from 4-
##### vinylbenzyl chloride and 4-vinyl pyridine by the suspension poly-
##### merization and Friedel-Crafts reaction. It was found that the cur-
##### rent NDPC could be good candidates for CO 2 capture, and a new
##### idea was proposed for the design of porous carbons e the ultra-
##### micropore walls modi ﬁ ed with plentiful heteroatoms. The volume
##### of ultramicropores was shown to be a critical element in CO 2
##### adsorption. The developed material exhibited satisfactory CO 2 up-
##### take (6.11 mmol/g at 0   C and 1 bar) and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity (11.2) of
##### the developed material were satisfactory. Similar outcomes were
##### achieved in the experiment using imidazole-based HCPs. In the
##### other study, Shao et al. [ 479 ] observed that the NDPCs exhibited a
##### large BET surface area (1248 e 2059 m 2 /g) and pore volume
##### (0.80 e 1.12 cm 3 /g). At low pressure, these NPCs adsorbed a large
##### amount ##### of ##### CO 2 ##### (4.09 e 5.86 ##### mmol/g ##### at ##### 0  C ##### and ##### 1 ##### bar,
##### 0.93 e 1.66 mmol/g at 0   C and 0.15 bar). In conclusion, it was
##### determined that in comparison to porosity, the nitrogen concen-

##### 3.5. Zeolites

##### Since the seminal discovery made by Cronstedt in 1756, zeolites
##### have attracted signi ﬁ cant scholarly interest, leading to several
##### practical applications in recent decades. Zeolites offer several ad-
##### vantages, including cyclic stability, high surface area, and extremely
##### fast kinetics of CO 2 adsorption compared to other solid sorbents
##### [ 483 , 484 ]. They additionally possess robust adsorption sites and
##### show favorable mechanical properties, including high abrasion
##### resistance, density, and mechanical strength, enabling their for-
##### mation ##### into ##### granules, ##### spheres, ##### and ##### extrudates ##### [ 485 e 487 ].
##### Furthermore, these CO 2 capture materials have an immense
##### adsorption ##### capacity ##### under ##### moderate ##### operating ##### conditions
##### (0 e 100   C, 0.1 e 1 bar) [ 488 ], which is strongly in ﬂ uenced by tem-
##### perature and is positively correlated with their pore size [ 489 ].
##### Unfortunately, if the temperature approaches 100   C, the CO 2 up-
##### take of zeolites drops dramatically. According to lately review of
##### Kumar et al. [ 489 ], it was indicated that the optimal temperature for
##### CO 2 adsorption on zeolites is 70   C, which is lower than the typical
##### ﬂ ue gas temperature (normally 90   C). Therefore, either cooling the
##### ﬂ ue gas or modifying the adsorbents to render them suitable for
##### high-temperature adsorption is necessary before their industrial-
##### scale implementation. On the other hand, introduction an addi-
##### tional process, such as cooling, could lead to increased energy
##### consumption and higher costs in CO 2 capture technology. Hence,
##### addressing this aspect effectively in the future is crucial. Fig. 29
##### provides ##### a ##### schematic ##### representation ##### of ##### the ##### zeolites ##### most
##### frequently mentioned in the literature for applications in CO 2
##### adsorption.
##### In last years, more publications have been published in zeolite
##### discipline, and it is apparent that researchers are concentrating their
##### efforts on a few key areas, including: (1) searching for new raw
##### materials, (2) new synthetic methodologies of synthesis, (3)
##### designing of textural properties and material composition (by
##### changing the Si/Al ratio, development of porosity), (4) cation ex-
##### change, (5) amine functionalization, (6) reduction of adverse
##### moisture-related impacts, and (7) developing composite/hybrid
##### materials. ##### Furthermore, ##### regarding ##### the ##### latest ##### ﬁ rst-principles
##### modeling for the design of materials in CO 2 capture technologies,
##### Yuan et al. [ 490 ] stated that utilizing DFT fundamentals to analyze
##### CO 2 adsorption behavior on zeolites can be applied to predict mul-
##### tiple factors, such as adsorption capacity, preferred sites, and selec-
##### tive adsorption between different gaseous mixtures. The same
##### quantum-mechanical ##### method ##### for ##### modeling ##### non-covalent ##### in-
##### teractions and thermochemistry, has been reported in many other
##### papers [ 491 e 495 ]. Currently, molecular simulations play a crucial
##### role in advancing understanding of the correlation between micro-
##### scopic and macroscopic characteristics within zeolites. Gaining in-
##### sights into the adsorption characteristics of zeolites could enhance
##### knowledge of the underlying processes of adsorption and diffusion
##### phenomena. Also, it can contribute to identifying further potential
##### applications of zeolites as CO 2 adsorbents. The generic methodology
##### was comprehensively described by García-P  ##### erez et al. [ 496 ].
##### Zeolites can be categorized into natural and synthetic. Natural
##### ones are used as dryers, deodorants, for air separation, ion ex-
##### change (in water treatment, especially heavy metal ions), and soil
##### improvement. Synthetics are exploited primarily for research and
##### industry and possess several distinct advantages over those that
##### occur in nature. One of them is the possibility of achieving un-
##### precedented levels of control over the material porosity and

##### crystallinity that are not achievable in nature. On the contrary, in
##### terms of CO 2 capture, synthetic zeolites tend to be more expensive
##### compared to more affordable natural zeolites, which, despite their
##### lower cost, often display inferior sorption properties, varying
##### composition, and reduced purity [ 497 ].
##### Over the last few decades, waste management and the reduction
##### of costs in the synthesis process of zeolites have gained importance
##### in many sectors of the industry. A substantial amount of research
##### has been dedicated to both the reuse of ﬂ y ash as a raw material and
##### the exploitation of natural material. Garshasbi et al. [ 498 ] prepared
##### zeolite 13X synthesized by hydrothermal treatment using natural
##### clays. The zeolite 13X demonstrated a superior BET surface area
##### (591.22 m 2 /g), CO 2 uptake (6.9 mmol/g) and micropore volume
##### (0.250 cm 3 /g) compared to the other materials studied. Chen et al.
##### [ 499 ] prepared zeolite 13X using bentonite as raw material by
##### alkaline fusion followed by hydrothermal treatment. It was deter-
##### mined that the newly synthesized zeolite 13X had high BET surface
##### area of 688 m 2 /g, a large micropore volume of 0.30 cm 3 /g, and
##### exhibited substantial CO 2 capture capacity (4.80 mmol/g) along
##### with selectivity (CO 2 /N 2 ¼ 37) at 25   C and 1 bar. Considering these
##### details, the variety of natural and synthetic zeolites makes them
##### appealing for use in the CO 2 adsorption process due to their un-
##### usual versatility.
##### Zeolites are a class of highly porous crystalline aluminosilicates,
##### composed of tetrahedrons formed by shared oxygen atoms of
##### alumina and silica, characterized by the formula TO 4 (T ¼ Si or Al)
##### [ 500 ]. Such a substitution leads to the accumulation of negative
##### charge in their pore structure, leading to an increase in basicity
##### when incorporating a higher concentration of aluminum atoms in
##### the framework [ 501 ]. This is owing to the weaker electronegativity
##### of aluminum compared to silica, which causes this effect. Further-
##### more, cations (Li þ , Na þ , Ca 2 þ , etc.) are present in the zeolite's
##### channels and chamber systems, with strictly de ﬁ ned molecular
##### sizes to compensate for this negative charge. This gives rise to
##### another key aspect of zeolites, namely, ion exchange [ 502 ].
##### Consequently, the alteration of the Si/Al ratio is of signi ﬁ cant
##### importance, as higher basicity corresponds to greater CO 2 adsorp-
##### tion capacity of zeolites [ 503 ]. The different Si/Al ratios in zeolites
##### determine their properties. Low-silica zeolites (Si/Al &lt; 2) exhibit
##### considerable acid resistance and thermal stability, as well as hy-
##### drophilic properties. Conversely, high-silica zeolites (Si/Al &gt; 50) are
##### characterized by an increased degree of ion exchange, and hydro-
##### phobicity [ 504 ]. Overall, this parameter signi ﬁ es the focus of
##### research endeavors concerning zeolite-based adsorbents, specif-
##### ically centered around optimizing material composition through
##### diverse synthesis approaches. Further, due to the de ﬁ ned crystal
##### structure, zeolites show a very narrow pore size range from 0.5 to
##### 1.2 nm [ 505 ]. As a direct consequence of possessing that property,
##### zeolites can effectively separate CO 2 molecules through a molecular
##### sieving process, because of their tailorable cavities and tunable
##### pore sizes. The presence of microporosity in zeolites classi ﬁ es them
##### as molecular sieves, enabling pore size-dependent adsorption
##### selectivity ( Fig. 30 ) [ 506 ]. In this case, only gas molecules with a
##### kinetic diameter smaller than the pore size of the zeolite can be
##### adsorbed. Hence, the topologies and pore diameters within the
##### crystal lattice are important criteria in the research for developing
##### CO 2 capture materials based on zeolites. Introducing mesopores
##### into microporous zeolites, achieved through the synthesis of hier-
##### archical porous materials, stands as one of the most promising
##### approaches for creating novel structures with tailored chemical and
##### textural attributes [ 507 e 510 ]. It offers the combined bene ﬁ ts of
##### improved CO 2 adsorption properties and enhanced mass transfer
##### through the mesoporous channels, due to adaptable porous struc-
##### ture that effectively addresses limitations in molecule diffusion
##### [ 511 , 512 ].

##### expanded surface area (126 m 2 /g), increased mesopore volume
##### (0.44 cm 3 /g), and coexistence of micropores (about 0.4 nm) with

##### presence of mesopores increased the rapid gas diffusion within the
##### pores during both adsorption and desorption. As an outcome, the
##### CO 2 adsorption ef ﬁ ciency was improved, while maintaining an
##### acceptable regeneration energy requirement. Dabbawala et al. [ 514 ]
##### designed ##### the ##### synthesis ##### of ##### hierarchical ##### porous ##### zeolite-Y ##### by
##### employing cationic polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium chlo-

##### reported that the hierarchical zeolite-Y had a higher CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity (ranging from 5.4 to 5.9 mmol/g) and better selectivity
##### (reaching up to 160) than microporous zeolite-Y. Liu et al. [ 515 ]
##### prepared hierarchical porous zeolite (HP-ZSM-5) combining both

##### dealumination of zeolite structures, leading to the disintegration of

##### can also negatively affect CO 2 capture. Panda et al. [ 513 ] investi-
##### gated the CO 2 adsorption performance of HZ4A under humid con-
##### ditions, with HZ4A-1  3 exhibiting a CO 2 uptake of 1.36 mmol/g at
##### 40   C and retaining 34.67% of CO 2 adsorption (0.61 mmol/g) in

##### distinct advantage. Consequently, HZ4A-13 holds promise for CO 2
##### capture in humid ﬂ ue gas environments within extensive coal- ﬁ red
##### power plant operations.

##### on CO 2 adsorption performance and textural properties is pre-
##### sented in Table 16 . Fig. 31 provides a broad overview of the modi-
##### ﬁ cation strategies and their associated research directions for
##### zeolites in CO 2 capture.

##### 3.6. Alumina

##### By combining an alumina-aerogel support with K 2 CO 3 , Bar-
##### arpour et al. [ 542 ] developed a unique process for the production of
##### solid sorbents in the post-combustion CO 2 capture process with
##### very high CO 2 capture capacity and stability. Compared to previous
##### investigations on alumina-based materials, the alumina-aerogel
##### support ##### showed ##### a ##### signi ﬁ cantly ##### higher ##### BET surface ##### area ##### of
##### 2019 m 2 /g, an achievement that had not been attained in previous
##### studies for this speci ﬁ c type of material. Under optimal conditions,
##### the sorbent achieved a notable CO 2 capture capacity of 7.2 mmol/g
##### at 56.1   C, which was statistically signi ﬁ cant. In another research,
##### Bararpour et al. [ 546 ] investigated the in ﬂ uence of textural qualities
##### on the performance of the mesoporous alumina supported K 2 CO 3 .
##### Al 2 O 3 was synthesized using a surfactant-assisted technique. The
##### support constructed with a surfactant-to-Al ratio of 0.5 possessed
##### the highest CO 2 uptake of 5.7 mmol/g and stayed stable during 15
##### cycles of carbonation/regeneration. This increase was related to the
##### existence of numerous active sites for carbonation reactions, lead-
##### ing to an enhanced CO 2 capture capacity. Studies on the function-
##### alization of aluminum support with ionic liquids have also been
##### reported by Sun et al. [ 552 ].
##### Hiremath et al. [ 553 ] presented a facile, green, and template-free
##### synthesis of mesoporous Al 2 O 3 for effective insertion of MgO to
##### generate strong basicity. Signi ﬁ cantly, the material was endowed
##### with strong basicity, thereby eliminating the loss of active surface
##### area. The approach showed a scalable mesoporous structure with an
##### excellent surface area of 315 m 2 /g, characterized by a narrow pore
##### size distribution (PSD). Furthermore, the incorporation of MgO as a
##### heteroatom into the mesoporous alumina framework resulted in an
##### improved surface area of 357 m 2 /g, while maintaining PSD. An ad-
##### vantageous aspect of the developed material was its improvement in
##### basicity, increasing from 1.13 to 2.73 mmol/g. This improvement
##### increased the af ﬁ nity of the adsorbent surface for CO 2 molecules.
##### Zhou et al. [ 549 ] synthesized and immobilized polymeric ionic
##### liquids (PILs) on mesoporous g - Al 2 O 3 (MA) using the ultrasonic
##### immersion method. The experimental results showed that P[VCIm]
##### Cl/MA demonstrated the highest CO 2 adsorption capacity among all
##### adsorbents. The maximum value reached 0.562 mmol/g and
##### occurred under optimal working conditions, including a loading
##### ratio of 1:1, a temperature of 40   C, a pressure of 5 bar, and a CO 2
##### ﬂ ow rate of 10 mL/min.
##### Another noteworthy research direction is the extraction of
##### alumina from coal-based solid waste, which serves as a means to
##### mitigate environmental hazards. Li et al. [ 550 ] prepared amine-
##### functionalized ##### CO 2 ##### adsorbents ##### by ##### grafting ##### APTES ##### with ##### the
##### alumina residue and the alumina-extracted residue. The ﬁ ndings
##### indicated that under conditions of 25   C and 100 vol% CO 2 feed ﬂ ow,
##### the sample treated with 12 mmol of APTES exhibited a peak CO 2
##### adsorption capacity of 1.23 mmol/g. The sorbent was successfully
##### regenerated at 110   C and maintained a stable uptake over 5
##### repeated adsorption-desorption cycles. Fig. 33 highlights related to
##### alumina that have been published in the literature.

##### Basic alumina, also referred to as aluminum oxide, is a well-
##### recognized support material utilized in CO 2 adsorption applica-
##### tions, existing in multiple crystallographic forms (with approxi-
##### mately 27 forms reported to date). Substrates associated with the
##### synthesis of Al 2 O 3 encompass aluminum-containing minerals, such
##### as aluminum hydroxide and oxyhydroxide, the most known are
##### bayerite ##### ( a -Al(OH) 3 ##### or #### b -Al(OH) 3 ), ##### gibbsite ##### (Al 2 O 3 $ 3H 2 O ##### or
##### Al(OH) 3 ), boehmite ( g -AlO $ OH), diaspore ( a -AlO $ OH), and pseu-
##### doboehmite [ 536 ]. These chemical compounds differ in the
##### arrangement sequence of atomic layers and the distance between
##### them. Subsequently, they are subjected to the Bayer process as raw
##### materials for alumina production. This procedure can be catego-
##### rized into three steps: extraction, precipitation, and calcination
##### [ 537 ]. The various metastable phases of Al 2 O 3 obtained through this
##### method are primarily in ﬂ uenced by the temperature of thermal
##### treatment, the type of natural ore, and the pH of solution during the
##### neutralization process of aluminum salt [ 538 ]. The most recogniz-
##### able crystal types of alumina are alpha ( a ), rho ( r ), gamma ( g ), eta
##### ( h ), chi ( c ), theta ( q ), delta (ð), and kappa ( 8 ). The g -, r - and a -types
##### are the most frequently observed on an industrial scale [ 539 ].
##### Fig. 32 presents an overview of the commonly utilized alumina
##### phases in CO 2 adsorption applications.
##### The use of an all-alumina support for CO 2 adsorption offers
##### many ##### prominent ##### bene ﬁ ts. ##### These ##### advantages ##### include ##### cost-
##### effectiveness, exceptional crystallinity, high speci ﬁ c surface area,
##### well-tailored mesoporosity, large pore volumes, as well as superior
##### chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability [ 319 , 540 , 541 ]. Current
##### research trends mainly focus on enhancing the physicochemical
##### properties of Al 2 O 3 -based supports to improve CO 2 adsorption ca-
##### pacity, stabilize adsorption-desorption cycles, and increase CO 2
##### selectivity over CH 4 /N 2 in ﬂ ue gas streams. These covers optimizing
##### texture characteristics, periodicity, long-range order, the distribu-
##### tion, or number of active sites, as well as adjusting basicity to
##### strengthen the interaction between the adsorbent surface and CO 2
##### molecules. According to the modi ﬁ cations reported in the literature

##### 3.7. Metal oxides

##### One of the strategies for CO 2 capture involves the utilization of
##### metal oxides as adsorbents. These materials, including calcium
##### oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), iron
##### oxides (F x O x ), and their various combinations, can be directly
##### applied in a CO 2 -solid reaction to form metal carbonates ( Fig. 34 ).
##### The choice of these particular metal oxides is deeply interrelated by
##### the objective of producing a thermodynamically stable carbonized
##### material as the end product [ 555 ]. Consequently, it is feasible to
##### thermally desorb CO 2 molecules that have been adsorbed and then
##### regenerate the adsorbent. Carbonation reactions generally release
##### heat (exothermic), whereas carbonate breakdown reactions require
##### heat input (endothermic), enabling the establishment of a cyclic
##### process [ 556 e 559 ].

##### 3.7.1. Titanium dioxide
##### Titanium dioxide has attracted considerable interest among
##### researchers due to its ef ﬁ cacy as an adsorbent, with distinctive
##### characteristics making it suited to a range of industrial and envi-
##### ronmental applications. Remarkably, it demonstrates a strong af-
##### ﬁ nity towards CO 2 [ 560 ], high adsorption capacity, and selective
##### adsorptions based on the size of absorbate molecules due to its
##### unsaturated surface atoms [ 332 ]. Hence, TiO 2 has also been widely

##### Regarding a potential CO 2 composite adsorbent, Chowdhury
##### et al. [ 332 ] studied mesoporous titanium dioxide/graphene oxide
##### (TiO 2 /GO) nanocomposites using varying ratios of GO to TiO 2 mass.
##### The material with the lowest GO to TiO 2 mass ratio, due to its wide
##### speci ﬁ c ##### surface ##### area ##### (99.536 ##### m 2 /g) ##### and ##### total ##### pore ##### volume
##### (0.382 cm 3 /g), displayed the highest adsorption rate. The achieved
##### maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity was 1.88 mmol/g at 25   C and
##### 1 bar, a value signi ﬁ cantly surpassing that of various other CO 2
##### adsorbents, including zeolite, activated carbon, and speci ﬁ c MOFs,
##### among others. Furthermore, the TiO 2 /GO composite exhibited rapid
##### CO 2 uptake kinetics and excellent CO 2 /N 2 selectivity, suggesting its
##### potential for further exploration in CO 2 capture applications.
##### Mixed oxides represent an alternative option for CO 2 adsorption
##### performance ##### enhancement. ##### Jeon ##### et ##### al. ##### [ 556 ] ##### synthesized
##### mixed oxides of mesoporous MgO/TiO 2 containing spherical nano-
##### particles through a sol e gel process. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption
##### research demonstrated an increase in the surface area and total pore
##### volume of mixed MgO/TiO 2 oxide, as well as the formation of
##### bimodal pores. Because of this, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the
##### MgO/TiO 2 was found to be substantially higher (0.477 mmol/g at
##### 25   C and 1 bar) compared to the individual pure oxides. Wu et al.
##### [ 578 ] focused on the preparation of TiO 2 coated nano CaO-based
##### adsorbent. The results revealed a considerable increase in the
##### endurance of the adsorption capacity. After 40 cycles of carbonation-
##### calcination, nano CaO-based adsorbent with an optimal TiO 2 con-
##### centration of 10% exhibited considerably more stable CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity (5.3 mmol/g) than CaO without TiO 2 coating (3.7 mmol/g).

##### Fig. 35 compares the reported modi ﬁ cation strategies and their
##### related research directions for TiO 2 in CO 2 capture.

##### utilized in the separation of CO 2 from ﬂ ue gas streams. Further-
##### more, its signi ﬁ cant surface area and tight range of pore sizes result
##### in a shorter time period required to achieve adsorption equilibrium
##### [ 561 ]. It is closely related to the high regularity in mesopore
##### channels with access to active sites, which signi ﬁ cantly improves
##### the diffusion rate, ensuring the rapid uptake of gas molecules
##### during adsorption [ 562 ].
##### Currently, titanium dioxide is primarily exploited as a catalyst,
##### giving rise to the development of new hybrid materials for CO 2
##### conversion processes. Research in this ﬁ eld mainly centers on the
##### photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into valuable chemical compounds,
##### such as solar fuels [ 563 e 569 ]. The literature has documented in-
##### vestigations into the direct implementation of TiO 2 for CO 2 capture.
##### These ##### studies ##### concern ##### optimizing ##### amine ##### functionalization
##### [ 332 , 570 e 575 ], incorporating phosphorus [ 576 ], and developing
##### composite materials with other solid adsorbents. This leads to
##### increased ##### adsorption ##### capacity ##### and ##### improved ##### cyclic ##### stability
##### compared to the parent materials [ 556 , 577 , 578 ].
##### According to Ota et al. [ 575 ], while the wide variety of TiO 2
##### structures exist, including particulate, tube, rod, sheet, and
##### sponge, there is relatively limited research comparing amine
##### functionalization to other porous materials. This is due to a low
##### concentration of OH groups on the surface of TiO 2 , which makes
##### it challenging to achieve signi ﬁ cant modi ﬁ cations with high
##### levels of amines. Consequently, the authors developed a tech-
##### nique to synthesize new amorphous TiO 2 nanoparticles with a
##### diameter of 3 nm, a large surface area of 617 m 2 /g, and a higher
##### concentration of OH groups. Compared to conventional TiO 2 ,
##### amorphous TiO 2 nanoparticles treated with ethylenediamine
##### demonstrated a higher CO 2 adsorption capacity (2.90 mmol/g at
##### 0   C and 1 bar). The tuning of the ethylenediamine quantity
##### bound to the particles enhanced their CO 2 uptake without
##### impeding pore accessibility.

##### 3.7.2. Iron oxides

##### their surfaces, capable of interacting with gaseous CO 2 molecules

##### this sector consumes a substantial quantity of fossil fuels and ac-
##### counts for approximately 7% of global CO 2 emissions [ 581 ].
##### Unfortunately, the catalytic role of iron oxide in CO 2 adsorption
##### and desorption has not been conclusively proved yet. The surface
##### interaction of iron oxide gradually revealed various carbonate
##### species, including monodentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate,
##### bicarbonate, and carboxylate [ 582 ]. In order to gain a deeper un-
##### derstanding of the CO 2 adsorption mechanism, it is essential to
##### provide detailed explanations. Hakim et al. [ 582 ] studied CO 2
##### adsorption and desorption properties using FeO, Fe 2 O 3 , and Fe 3 O 4 ,
##### as absorbents, mainly due to the basicity and porosity of the
##### morphology. In the case of Fe 2 O 3 , the study revealed the presence
##### of various basic sites, including weak, medium, strong, and very
##### strong phases. Fe 3 O 4 , despite its potential for use in CO 2 capture,
##### showed instability in adsorbing higher concentrations of carbon
##### dioxide, resulting in its oxidation to form Fe 2 O 3 . On the other hand,
##### among the other oxides, Fe 2 O 3 exhibited the most signi ﬁ cant in-
##### crease in BET speci ﬁ c surface area and the highest CO 2 adsorption
##### capacity after undergoing four cycles of adsorption-desorption
##### (0.50 mmol/g). The authors concluded that enhancing CO 2 cap-
##### ture ef ﬁ ciency can be achieved through chemical modi ﬁ cation of
##### the Fe 2 O 3 surface, either by increasing its basicity through the
##### addition of basic metal oxides or by optimizing the surface through
##### the use of appropriate support materials.
##### Recently, Mendoza et al. [ 583 ] presented a novel method for
##### capturing CO 2 by mixtures of raw materials used in the steel in-
##### dustry (Fe 3 O 4 þ Fe and Fe 2 O 3 þ Fe). Based on CO 2 pressure and
##### planetary ball mill process parameters, they examined the kinetics
##### of mechanically stimulated chemical reactions between iron oxides
##### and CO 2 . By applying increased CO 2 pressure (10 e 30 bar) and room
##### temperature, it was assumed that total carbonation of iron oxides
##### may be accomplished. Under the same pressure, temperature, and
##### reaction time as the Fe 2 O 3 and Fe system, the CO 2 capture capacity
##### of Fe 3 O 4 and Fe was 13.87 mmol/g, which was comparatively lower.

##### [ 579 ]. Iron-based solid sorbents offer several key advantages,
##### including their accessibility, favorable thermodynamics, cost-
##### effectiveness, straightforward synthesis, abundance, and sus-
##### tained adsorption capacity with slow degradation over time [ 580 ].
##### Iron oxides, especially, present an attractive option for CO 2 capture
##### in iron mills due to the potential for multiple cycles of carbonation
##### and regeneration within the same ironmaking facility, allowing for
##### seamless integration with steel production processes. Furthermore,

##### magnesium oxide, as presented in equation (8) :

adsorbents.

##### Fig. 37 illustrates the current status of modi ﬁ cation strategies for
##### MgO-based adsorbents, as well as future research directions.
##### Further, the CO 2 capture performance is summarized in Table 18
##### and Table 19 .

##### As a result, depending on the adsorption conditions and the
##### structure of solid surface, several types of complexes are formed,
##### such as bicarbonate, unidentate carbonate, and bidentate carbonate
##### [ 584 e 586 ]. Fast physisorption occurs at low temperatures, whereas
##### slower chemisorption takes place at high temperatures.
##### Initially, MgO was deemed unsuitable for high temperature CO 2
##### capture applications due to its inherent drawbacks. They partly
##### include a limited practical CO 2 adsorption capacity at elevated
##### temperatures due to restricted CO 2 access to the internal cavities,
##### which is constrained by a small speci ﬁ c surface area and very
##### sluggish ##### kinetics ##### [ 587 ]. ##### Furthermore, ##### MgO-based ##### adsorbents
##### frequently raise concerns about thermal stability since they require
##### very high temperatures during the desorption stage [ 588 , 589 ]. This
##### phenomenon is related to sintering processes taking place within
##### the adsorbent, leading to the formation of a carbonate termination
##### layer on the surface when the temperature surpasses a speci ﬁ c
##### threshold. Consequently, this leads to a decrease in surface area and
##### a decline in both CO 2 capture performance and recyclability. Due to
##### these limitations, MgO-based materials are less cost-effective for
##### industrial applications [ 519 , 590 ].
##### Nonetheless, there is a growing interest in reevaluating the
##### suitability of MgO for CO 2 adsorption, owing to its lower energy
##### consumption ( &lt; 500   C) in comparison to alternatives like Li 2 O and
##### CaO [ 584 , 587 ], its affordability, abundant precursors, and ad-
##### vancements in materials science. Furthermore, magnesium oxide
##### presents itself as a promising option for CO 2 capture applications
##### owing to its distinctive attributes, such as appropriate surface ba-
##### sicity leading to the creation of oxygen vacancies that directly
##### impact adsorption performance [ 591 e 595 ]. As a result, several in-
##### vestigations ##### have ##### been ##### conducted ##### to ##### improve ##### ef ﬁ cient ##### CO 2
##### adsorption by MgO-based adsorbents, including their distribution
##### on porous supports, metal doping, using different synthesis
##### methods (precipitation method, double-replicate, aerogel method,
##### sol-gel method, and many others), in ﬂ uence of surfactants, effect of
##### the magnesium precursors, amine functionalization, synthesizing
##### molten salt-modi ﬁ ed MgO (alkali metal nitrate/carbonate), and
##### mixed metal oxides.
##### Recently, Ruhaimi et al. [ 596 ] provided the most in-depth
##### analysis to date of the review on MgO-based adsorbents prepared
##### through diverse modi ﬁ cation strategies using different approaches
##### of synthesis and promoters. The authors suggested that merging
##### innovative concepts and trends from other separation processes
##### could enhance the economic viability and optimization of pro-
##### moters in the adsorbent preparation. One approach could involve
##### creating adsorbents with distinct morphological characteristics
##### derived from biomass, along with the application of promoter
##### optimization techniques like spray coating and aerosol impaction-
##### driven assembly. Moreover, inclusion of promoters, hybrid adsor-
##### bents, and amine functionalization with the aid of a stabilizer may
##### help to increase the cycle stability even further. It is also crucial to
##### consider real-world industrial conditions, which often involve
##### gaseous impurities like NO x and SO x in the ﬂ ue gas stream, as well
##### as the presence of moisture.

##### 3.7.4. Calcium oxide
##### Calcium oxide has been widely investigated for CO 2 adsorption
##### due to its superior thermodynamic and chemical properties,
##### enhanced regeneration capabilities, as well as its affordability and
##### natural abundance in the form of carbonates like limestone and
##### dolomite [ 628 ]. Furthermore, CaO offers durability, low toxicity,
##### recyclability of spent materials, environmental friendliness, the
##### potential for CO 2 removal from ﬂ ue gases in hydrogen generation
##### processes, high reactivity towards CO 2 across a broad temperature
##### range of 500 e 900   C (allowing for heat recovery possibilities), and
##### versatility in ﬂ uidized bed applications. Consequently, CaO has
##### been a subject of research for many years [ 629 e 634 ]. The adsorp-
##### tion capacity of calcium oxide is affected by several parameters,
##### including ##### partial ##### pressure ##### of ##### CO 2 , ##### particle ##### size, ##### material
##### morphology, and precursor nature [ 519 , 635 ].
##### Upon exposure to elevated temperatures, CaO undergoes a re-
##### action with CO 2 on its surface, involving the nucleation and growth
##### of CaCO 3 . The carbonation process of CaO can be divided into two
##### stages: a rapid phase controlled by kinetics, followed by a slower
##### phase controlled by diffusion [ 636 ]. Carbonation of CaO concludes
##### once a layer of CaCO 3 accumulates and forms over the unreacted

##### adsorbent. The carbonated sorbent can be regenerated through
##### calcination, leading to the restoration of CaO, which can be reused for
##### subsequent CO 2 sorption. This approach, known as calcium looping,
##### involves the cyclic utilization of CaO. The underlying chemisorption
##### mechanisms during CO 2 adsorption (carbonation) and desorption
##### (decarbonation/calcination) by CaO are shown below:

##### entrainment, and material attrition in some cases [ 630 ]. Extensive
##### research efforts have aimed to address these challenges related to
##### CaO as a CO 2 adsorbent, focusing on improving its stability and
##### recyclability through a variety of techniques.
##### In 2018, Sun et al. [ 640 ] reviewed the progress in the develop-
##### ment and application of CaO-based adsorbents for CO 2 capture and
##### provided an understanding of the basic elements of cyclic carbon-
##### ation/calcium in a systematic way. The authors identi ﬁ ed four main
##### strategies for enhancing CO 2 uptake of CaO-based materials, which
##### include producing synthetic CaO with high surface area (employing
##### diverse ##### CaO ##### precursors ##### and ##### re ﬁ ning ##### synthesis ##### techniques),
##### dispersing CaO on inert supports (utilizing bimetallic metal oxides,
##### other metal oxides), applying surface modi ﬁ cations (using organic
##### acids, mineral acids), and improving CO 2 capture during rigorous
##### calcination conditions. Furthermore, they identi ﬁ ed several issues
##### that need to be thoroughly addressed during the creation of novel
##### adsorbents. In terms of material stability, nanoparticles with a stable
##### framework and porous structure are critical. Additionally, new CaO-
##### based adsorbents are rarely evaluated under exceptional conditions,
##### such as regeneration at 100% CO 2 , and the challenge of their attrition
##### is infrequently reported. Another consideration is also whether the
##### synthesis is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly.
##### In the same year, Salaudeen et al. [ 628 ] discussed current ad-
##### vances in metal-based solid sorbents with a particular focus on
##### calcium oxide and presented the use of biomass as competitive
##### sources of CaCO 3 . This review showed that adsorbent hydration is

##### an ef ﬁ cient method for regenerating and optimizing multiple re-
##### action cycles. Furthermore, while the stability of CaO-based solid
##### sorbents has been described in literature in the presence of various
##### inert supports or dopants, the fundamental mechanisms of this
##### phenomenon are not yet fully comprehended. To gain a deeper
##### understanding of the principles and potential factors that impact
##### the relationship between sorbent performance and inert support,

##### emerges as a potential source. However, con ﬂ icting results exist
##### regarding the comparative advantages of calcined shells versus
##### calcined limestone. Addressing this discrepancy might require
##### further experimentation and the application of kinetic modeling.
##### Numerous other studies have also highlighted the potential value of

##### shells to synthesize modi ﬁ ed structure CaO through the use of
##### organic acids, demonstrating that eggshells could serve as a cost-

##### In the ﬁ eld of novel research directions in CaO-based materials,

##### 3.7.5. Cerium oxide
##### Cerium oxide, also referred to as ceria, has been extensively
##### studied and has garnered signi ﬁ cant attention within the ﬁ eld of
##### catalysts and catalytic supports [ 658 ]. Ceria demonstrates distinc-
##### tive attributes in relation to its structural and thermal properties.
##### These characteristics encompass extensive accessible surface area,
##### rigid frameworks, notable interaction with CO 2 molecules at
##### ambient conditions (exhibiting Lewis-base active site properties),
##### orderly distribution of pore sizes, substantial capacity for oxygen
##### storage, and straightforward redox reaction [ 659 e 663 ].
##### Numerous efforts have been made to enhance the catalytic ac-
##### tivity of ceria by increasing its thermal stability and surface area
##### through the use of organized porous structures. The interaction of
##### cerium oxide with carbon dioxide has also been thoroughly char-
##### acterized [ 664 e 667 ]. However, despite ceria's ability to adsorb and
##### desorb CO 2 under ambient conditions, its practical application in
##### CO 2 capture hasn't been adequately investigated, particularly in
##### terms of adsorption capacity and the in ﬂ uencing factors.
##### In 2014, Yoshikawa et al. [ 668 ] detailed the synthesis and
##### analysis of cerium oxide-based adsorbents, providing the ﬁ rst
##### coherent measurement of CO 2 uptake. The authors investigated CO 2
##### capture materials derived from various single metal oxides (SiO 2 ,
##### Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 ). CeO 2 exhibited the highest CO 2 adsorption capacity,
##### achieving 0.132 mmol/g at 50   C, along with its speci ﬁ c surface area
##### of 166 m 2 /g. Furthermore, the experimental results have revealed
##### essential insights into the factors that play a signi ﬁ cant role in
##### in ﬂ uencing the number of available CO 2 adsorption sites as well as
##### the overall CO 2 uptake of metal oxide materials. It was emphasized
##### that these encompass synthesis conditions, precursor choices that
##### could introduce surface contaminants hindering CO 2 adsorption,

##### 4. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) of CO 2 capture materials

##### In 2015, Li et al. [ 669 ] studied mesostructured ceria and ceria
##### doped with Mg, Zr, La, and Cu for CO 2 adsorption prepared using a
##### surfactant-templated method and tested at room temperature. The
##### ﬁ ndings indicated that the adsorption characteristics of the mate-
##### rials are in ﬂ uenced not only by their textural properties but also by
##### their surface chemistry, including acid e base sites and oxygen va-
##### cancies. These aspects are affected by the type and content of
##### dopants in the CeO 2 .
##### In 2017, Slostowski et al. [ 670 ] investigated the potential of CeO 2
##### nanoparticles as CO 2 adsorbents in the form of nanopowders,
##### focusing on their speci ﬁ c surface area. This method resulted in a
##### solid sorbent with a speci ﬁ c surface area of 199 m 2 /g. Additionally,
##### it showed a maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity of approximately
##### 1.13 mmol/g at 25   C and 1 pressure. The possibility of cycling CO 2
##### adsorption/desorption was also explored. Initial research indicated
##### the feasibility of adsorbing CO 2 at 25   C and nearly completely
##### regenerating the material at 150   C in an inert gas environment
##### without compromising the CO 2 capture capability. Therefore, CeO 2
##### with substantial speci ﬁ c surface areas hold great promise as po-
##### tential candidates for low-temperature reversible CO 2 capture
##### materials in the future.
##### In 2020, Azmi et al. [ 671 ] further elaborated on the amine func-
##### tionalization (APTMS) of mesoporous ceria nanoparticles (MCN) for
##### CO 2 capture. The introduction of APTMS functional groups onto MCN
##### enhanced the availability of CO 2 binding sites, evident through the
##### formation of carbamate species upon CO 2 interaction with the NH
##### groups. As a result, the adsorption capacity increased by up to tenfold
##### compared to the pristine oxide. However, the addition of APTMS to
##### the MCNs led to a reduction in their textural properties. This
##### decrease is attributed to the functionalization and blocking effect of
##### APTMS molecules within the MCN support.

##### A CO 2 sorption-based process utilizing the ef ﬁ cient and cost-
##### effective adsorbents has the potential to yield signi ﬁ cant techno-
##### logical and economic advantages. In line with ongoing theoretical
##### and practical research, there appear to be distinct categories of
##### materials exhibiting remarkable CO 2 capture capabilities. Primarily,
##### newly synthesized materials intended for industrial applications
##### must demonstrate ef ﬁ cacy within speci ﬁ c technological regenera-
##### tion con ﬁ gurations (in terms of pressure, temperature, electricity,
##### or combined cycles) and in various gas e solid contactors (such as
##### ﬁ xed, ﬂ uidized, moving, or rotating beds). This assessment is
##### pivotal, as it ultimately determines whether a technology based on
##### a particular adsorbent type can be economically viable for CO 2
##### capture from ﬂ ue gas in power plants. Integrated capture and
##### separation processes incur the most costs, making careful analysis
##### imperative prior to scaling up and introducing the technology at
##### manufacturing scale. Consequently, in order to facilitate a system-
##### atic and equitable comparison of CO 2 separation technologies, and
##### to comprehensively understand the techno-economic impacts
##### associated with implementing CO 2 capture systems across diverse
##### industries, techno-economic analysis is extremely essential.
##### In many cases of TEA, it's important to adopt a real model of a
##### coal- ﬁ red power plant at a speci ﬁ c scale, proportionally re ﬂ ecting
##### the electricity generation rate. This is closely associated with the
##### amount of fossil fuel consumption and, consequently, the resulting
##### CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere. The Emissions and Generation

##### the Pareto front demonstrated that the productivity index is
##### affected by factors such as the volume of zeolite 13X and the metal
##### used in forming the adsorption columns.
##### Subraveti et al. [ 675 ] also conducted a TEA analysis for post-
##### combustion CO 2 capture with cyclic process. Their goal was to
##### determine the cost limitations of PVSA cycles assuming the creation
##### of a 'perfect' cost-free adsorbent. Employing various carbon dioxide
##### compositions and industrial ﬂ ue gas ﬂ ow rates as inputs, the re-
##### searchers enhanced adsorbent characteristics (such as adsorption
##### isotherms and particle morphology) and process design parame-
##### ters. The objective aimed to examine the lowest possible CO 2
##### avoidance cost, excluding CO 2 conditioning, transport, and storage
##### expenses. The obtained results revealed insights into the CO 2
##### concentration in the ﬂ ue gas signi ﬁ cantly in ﬂ uencing the cost
##### limitations of PVSA. The lowest potential CO 2 avoidance costs
##### decrease as the CO 2 concentration increases. By applying a four-
##### step ##### PVSA ##### cycle ##### and ##### altering ##### the ##### pelletized ##### adsorbent's
##### morphology, CO 2 avoidance costs can be reduced by 9 e 22%. Opti-
##### mization highlighted that 'ideal' adsorbents for achieving the
##### lowest CO 2 avoidance costs have reasonably linear CO 2 adsorption
##### isotherms and minimal N 2 adsorption. The ﬂ ue gas ﬂ ow rate
##### notably impacts the complexity of the PVSA plant in terms of train
##### numbers, equipment, piping, and space requirements. The ultimate
##### cost of CO 2 avoided for PVSA varied from 87.1 to 10.4 V /tonne,
##### corresponding to CO 2 feed concentration of 3.5 e 30 mol%. When
##### compared with a monoethanolamine-based absorption method,
##### the ##### ﬁ ndings ##### indicated ##### that ##### PVSA ##### could ##### be ##### a ##### potentially
##### favorable separation technique for ﬂ ue gas streams with high CO 2
##### concentrations.
##### PSA technique has also been explored to assess its viability for
##### recovering CO 2 from post-combustion power plant ﬂ ue gases. In
##### 2008, Ho et al. [ 676 ] used commercial adsorbents, including zeolite
##### 13X with a working capacity of 2.2 mol/kg and a CO 2 /N 2 selectivity
##### of 54, to evaluate high-pressure feed and vacuum desorption in
##### their analysis. By utilizing vacuum desorption, the capture cost was
##### reduced from 57 to 51 $/tonne of CO 2 avoided. With this method,
##### both an 85% CO 2 recovery rate and a product that was 46% CO 2
##### enriched were achievable. Moreover, the authors found that when
##### combining the novel adsorbent with enhanced processing cycles
##### like depressurization, adsorber bed equalization, and product
##### purging, a CO 2 avoidance cost as low as 30 $/tonne could be
##### attainable.

##### 4.1. Techno-economic analysis (TEA): principles and procedures

##### Protection Agency) released in 2018, revealed that natural gas units
##### have an average CO 2 emission rate of 407 kg/MWh, while coal units
##### have an average CO 2 emission rate of 989 kg/MWh [ 672 ]. Hanak
##### and Manovic [ 673 ] determined the technical and economic feasi-
##### bility of a CO 2 capture system utilizing a molecularly imprinted
##### polymer sorbent based on acrylamide (MIP) within the context of
##### retro ﬁ tting a 580 MW coal- ﬁ red power plant. The cost of CO 2
##### avoided was calculated to be 29.3 £ /ton of CO 2 . This performance,
##### compared to a CO 2 capture system employing chemical solvents,
##### exhibited superior techno-economic viability. Parametric studies
##### indicated that the sorbent capacity had the most signi ﬁ cant impact
##### on the thermodynamic performance of the polymer. Furthermore,
##### the economic performance was in ﬂ uenced not only by the sorbent
##### capacity but also signi ﬁ cantly by its cyclic performance. The anal-
##### ysis ﬁ ndings demonstrated a linear relationship between the cost of
##### CO 2 avoided and increasing MIP sorbent makeup, at a rate of 6.8
##### £ /tCO 2 for each one-tenth percent increase in sorbent makeup.
##### As mentioned earlier in this review, there are several regener-
##### ation technologies that are commonly employed during the CO 2
##### capture process, including PSA, VSA, VPSA, TSA, TPSA, and ESA.
##### Zanco et al. [ 674 ] prepared a comparative techno-economic
##### evaluation for the post-combustion CO 2 capture process based on
##### mature technology for CO 2 separation, such as adsorption using
##### zeolite 13X in conventional ﬁ xed beds (either VSA or TSA). The
##### analysis assumed a carbon dioxide source emitting 12% CO 2 v/v
##### (with 95% relative humidity at the inlet conditions of 30   C and
##### 1.3 bar) to produce a CO 2 stream with 96% purity. Techno-economic
##### assessment revealed that while the studied adsorption process
##### might achieve cost competitiveness on a small scale, particularly
##### for very low recovery rates and small plant sizes, overcoming a
##### signi ﬁ cant cost gap is necessary to establish the adsorption process
##### as economically viable. Notably, cost components related to ﬂ ue gas
##### pre-drying contribute signi ﬁ cantly to this disparity. In this context,
##### innovative water-resistant adsorbents combined with more com-
##### plex process con ﬁ gurations could potentially reverse the observed
##### cost trends. Furthermore, the research highlighted that the unit
##### cost of the commercial adsorbent has a considerably lower impact
##### on investment costs compared to geometric constraints related to

##### Given the technological solutions discussed, a solid grasp of
##### key engineering data is imperative for multiple aspects, including
##### the development of CO 2 capture materials, designing installations
##### for CO 2 removal from ﬂ ue gas at pilot or industrial scales (through
##### computer simulations and numerical methods), and especially
##### conducting techno-economic analyses. As brie ﬂ y mentioned
##### earlier regarding the future prospects of CO 2 adsorbents, these
##### include the working and equilibrium capacity of beds within a
##### speci ﬁ c temperature, pressure, and absorbate concentration range
##### in ﬂ ue gas mixtures. Isothermal and kinetic data derived from
##### mathematical models analyzing experimental points are relevant.
##### Mass transfer considerations during the process, along with
##### identi ﬁ cation of diffusion mechanisms that govern the adsorption
##### process (surface diffusion, boundary layer effects, and adsorbate
##### diffusion within the internal porous structure of material), are
##### crucial. Additionally, the thermodynamics of adsorption and

##### regeneration steps in processes like TSA. Additionally, blowers,

##### like VPSA.
#####  Emphasis on the understanding that scaling and equilibrium
##### models should not be used for detailed process design or cost
##### estimation. Instead, they are more aptly suited for deliberate
##### selection to identify the most promising adsorbents.

##### the impact of impurities (such as NO 2 , SO 2 , H 2 S) or moisture in the
##### ﬂ ue gas undergoing separation, should be considered. When these
##### details are veri ﬁ ed as integral components of the overall pro-
##### cedure, the technical and economic phase of the analysis can
##### commence. The most crucial engineering data for conducting TEA
##### are depicted in Fig. 40 .
##### In addition to carbon dioxide capture technologies and cyclic
##### adsorption methods, the choice of bed is also pivotal within TEA.
##### When selecting a bed for a speci ﬁ c technology, its functionality
##### must be carefully analyzed. The utilization of a ﬂ uidized bed
##### intensi ﬁ es mass exchange between the gas mixture ﬂ owing
##### through its structure and the solid particles, owing to a sub-
##### stantial interface and effective mixing of the material with the
##### gas phase. This acceleration enhances the adsorption process
##### [ 677 , 678 ]. However, the ef ﬁ cacy of gas mixture contact with the
##### bed during ﬂ uidization can be compromised, especially by the
##### agglomeration of bed solids at higher temperatures, resulting
##### from van der Waals intermolecular forces for physical adsorption
##### [ 679 , 680 ]. This phenomenon leads to material heterogeneity,
##### characterized by crack and channel formation in the structure.
##### These channels allow the gas phase to bypass adsorbent parti-
##### cles, rendering the equilibrium of CO 2 adsorption ineffective
##### [ 681 , 682 ]. In contrast, an adsorbent in the form of a ﬁ xed bed
##### possesses a compact structure with speci ﬁ c internal and external
##### surfaces and consistent pore morphology. This directly impacts
##### the material's adsorption capacity during the process, resulting
##### in a higher concentration of adsorbent solids compared to a
##### ﬂ uidized bed. However, adsorption on a ﬁ xed bed also presents
##### challenges, including undesirable heat gradients, process control
##### complexities, and, crucially, dif ﬁ culties in regeneration during
##### CO 2 desorption.
##### In 2021, Danaci et al. [ 683 ] published guidelines for TEA on
##### adsorption processes, categorizing them into two main sections:
##### technical and economic issues. The aforementioned engineering
##### data forms an integral part of this determination. In each section,
##### the authors presented key factors with substantial in ﬂ uence, along
##### with the consequences of decisions made during the TEA phase and
##### recommended practices. Among these factors, parameters of the
##### bed type were highlighted for comprehensive consideration
##### throughout the procedure and as a reference point for the covered
##### topics. ##### Regarding ##### technical ##### considerations, ##### they ##### highlighted
##### essential aspects that demand attention, as follows:

##### In terms of process economics, the authors emphasized the
##### importance of several key aspects. These include IBL costing
##### methods (Inside Battery Limits), which focus on the primary pro-
##### cess equipment items involved in converting the feed into the ﬁ nal
##### product. The authors also highlighted the signi ﬁ cance of novel
##### technologies. For instance, ﬂ uidized beds for moving bed TSA and
##### rotary adsorbers for continuous TSA are being explored for
##### adsorption processes. Additionally, estimating the cost of the
##### adsorbent, particularly when it's not yet commercialized, can be
##### contentious, underscoring the importance of concentrating on
##### scale-up considerations. Lastly, the concern of other capital costs
##### completes the spectrum of factors.
##### Overall, a signi ﬁ cant objective of TEA studies is to develop cost-
##### effective process equipment designs tailored to the physical and
##### chemical properties of the adsorbent. Moreover, the wide array of
##### regeneration technologies available in different modes, process con-
##### ditions, reactor con ﬁ gurations, and types of adsorbents offers sub-

##### choice for CCUS technologies. Furthermore, key aspects related to
##### scaling up and the barriers that require addressing for the successful
##### commercialization of a given adsorbent have been highlighted.
