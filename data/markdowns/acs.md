ABSTRACT: This contribution provides a conceptual analysis and a quantitative comparative assessment of three technology
chains that enable a carbon neutral chemical industry in a net-zero-CO 2 world. These are based (i) on the use of fossil fuels and
current chemical processes and infrastructure coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS route), (ii) on the use of captured CO 2
as a feedstock together with “ green ” hydrogen in new chemical processes (CCU route), (iii) on the use of biomass grown and
processed for the speci ﬁ c purpose of making chemicals (BIO route). All routes are feasible and have di ﬀ erent pros and cons. Such
pros and cons are ﬁ rst discussed through a qualitative comparison of the three routes for a generic chemical product, and are then
quantitatively assessed for the speci ﬁ c case of methanol production. In this case, the CCU route results in an electricity consumption
10 to 25 times higher than that of the CCS and BIO routes (excluding the electricity required for heat production), mostly due to
the electricity required to produce hydrogen. At the same time, the BIO route requires a land capacity about 40 and 400 times higher
than that required by the CCU and CCS routes, respectively. Furthermore, when considering a net-positive-CO 2 emissions world,
the CO 2 emissions of the CCU route grow about 8 to 10 times faster than that of the CCS and BIO routes. On the one hand, we
identify key hurdles in all cases. These are (i) the availability, accessibility, and acceptance of CO 2 storage sites for the CCS route,
together with the continued use of fossil fuels; (ii) the very high electricity and energy demand for the CCU route, with the
associated strict requirement of very low carbon-intensity of the electricity mix; (iii) the very high availability of land for biomass
growth in the case of the BIO route, with the associated risks of con ﬂ ict with other uses. On the other hand, we underline that the
CCS route o ﬀ ers the possibility of using existing technologies and infrastructures, without the need of a complete reshaping of the
chemical industry, and of permanently removing CO 2 from the atmosphere, hence representing a key element not only in the net-
zero-CO 2 emissions world studied here, but also in a net-negative-CO 2 emissions world.

how the chemical industry can produce carbon-based products

paper aims at contributing to a very intense and timely debate
with both a conceptual analysis and a quantitative comparative
assessment of three di ﬀ erent technology chains. These three
routes are acknowledged to be the only possible approaches
toward a net-zero-CO 2 emissions (C-based) chemical
industry.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides
context and background, and states motivation and scope.
Section 3 describes the three technology chains in general
terms, and discusses similarities and di ﬀ erences in qualitative
terms. Section 4 analyzes methanol synthesis, use, and postuse
fate, and quanti ﬁ es thoroughly key technical performance
indicators for the three routes, thus clearly highlighting pros
and cons of the di ﬀ erent solutions. Finally, section 5 draws
conclusions.

##### 2. CONTEXT, BACKGROUND, MOTIVATION, AND
##### SCOPE

2.1. The Context: Sustainability Requires Net-Zero-
CO 2 Emissions in All Sectors by Midcentury. In a world
experiencing a climate crisis due to increasing GHG
(particularly CO 2 ) concentrations in the atmosphere, 1  all
sectors of human activity will have to decarbonize, from power
generation to mobility, from the industry to the built
environment. CO 2 emissions will have to be net-zero
sometime between 2040 and 2060, according to the IPCC
scenarios, lest the average temperature rise will exceed the
1.5 − 2 ° C maximum stipulated in 2015 by the Paris
agreement. 2

burned very soon after extraction). Some of these C-rich
products, for example, the windproof and waterproof garments
that owe their function to a per ﬂ uorinated polymer, deliver an
essential service and are based on a sequence of complex,
di ﬃ cult, and possibly dangerous chemical transformations and
physical manipulations that are at the heart of organic
chemistry and the related chemical engineering processes.
After such C-rich products have delivered their service (after a
period between a few days to a few years, very rarely after a
few decades), they are disposed of and turn sooner or later to
gaseous species (CO 2 or CH 4 depending on the disposal
conditions, i.e., incinerator or land ﬁ ll, respectively) that add to
the GHG emitted to the atmosphere. Plastics that are
disposed in land ﬁ ll or leaked to the environment (ultimately
reaching oceans) hold carbon longer, but, having an equally
bad e ﬀ ect on the environment, cannot be regarded as a
sustainable carbon storage solution (because of mismanaged
waste, 8 Mt/y  3% of global annual plastics waste  leaked to
the ocean in 2010, 3 , 4  with estimates for 20 Mt/y in 2050 5 ).
Hence in the case of the chemical industry, one should talk
about defossilization rather than about decarbonization, as it is
not possible to imagine a future without C-rich chemical
products, i.e. where humankind is still present. In this work,
we interpret defossilization quantitatively as a scenario
equivalent to net-zero-CO 2 emissions, in full agreement with
the IPCC scenario.
Many argue that the chemical industry can be defossilized
only by substituting the carbon provenience, that is, from the
high-energy reduced fossil-C to the oxidized low-energy
carbon in the CO 2 , that had been captured somehow from
CO 2 emitters or from the atmosphere. This is the so-called
CCU route (carbon capture and utilization). Accordingly, it is
argued that a brand-new chemical industry, organic chemistry,
and catalysis science must be developed that use CO 2 as the
source of carbon. At the same time, the question where under
the CCU scenario the missing energy and the missing
hydrogen atoms will be coming from is kept in the
background. 6 − 18

Climate change is due to the redistribution of carbon
among carbon pools: atmosphere (with about 800 Gt carbon),
hydrosphere (about 40,000 Gt), biosphere (i.e., vegetation
and soil, about 2,500 Gt), lithosphere (i.e., about 65,000,000
Gt, of which about 4,000 Gt consist of high-energy reduced
fossil-C in fossil fuels and the rest of low-energy oxidized
inorganic carbon ﬁ xed in carbonate minerals) and anthropo-
sphere (i.e., carbon stored in manufactured products, such as
fuels, fertilizers, polymers, estimated to be 2 to 3 Gt). While
natural exchanges between the ﬁ rst three pools are on the
order of 100 Gt C/y, GHG anthropogenic emissions are only
about 10 Gt C/y, but su ﬃ cient to disrupt the preindustrial
carbon balance and to change GHG concentrations in the
atmosphere.
In a net-zero-CO 2 emissions world at steady state, the
anthroposphere will have reached its carbon hold-up capacity
compliant with a given global average temperature increase,
for example, 1.5 ° C. Therefore, any carbon atom extracted
from the subsurface (lithosphere) will have to be returned to
it, lest it is sooner or later emitted to the atmosphere. And any
carbon atom released to the atmosphere as GHG (CO 2 being
the most important) will have to be pulled back out of it, thus
generating so-called negative emissions, to avoid the rise of
GHG concentration in the atmosphere and the global average
temperature also. If the 1.5 ° C carbon budget is overshoot,
the net-zero-CO 2 state has to be followed by a net-negative-
CO 2 state.
2.2. Defossilizing the Chemical Industry: Three
Alternative Approaches. The chemical industry will have
to be decarbonized as well, but faces a special challenge in that
an overwhelmingly large fraction of chemical products
contains carbon, mostly originating from fossil-C (note that
only a few percent of the total fossil-C produced today is used
for chemical products other than fuels, while the rest is

Others maintain that those C-rich chemicals should be
produced using biomass, 19 − 24  that is, within the scope of the
biore ﬁ nery concept. Note that biomass contains both carbon
and hydrogen atoms, as well as energy, namely solar energy
chemically stored thanks to photosynthesis, that is, the process
that uptakes CO 2 from the atmosphere and converts it into
biochemicals, from which in principle all chemicals currently
used can be derived.
There is also a third alternative though, where chemicals are
synthesized from fossil-C using the current organic chemistry;
the CO 2 generated at the end of life is captured back, returned
to the lithosphere where the fossil-C originally had come
from, and safely stored in suitable underground geological
structures. This is the so-called CCS route (carbon capture
and storage).
While the capture component of CCS is a “ conditio sine
qua non ” of CCU as well, the CO 2 storage element is unique
to CCS among the three options described here. Two remarks
are worth making though. First, CO 2 storage in aquifers and in
oil and gas reservoirs has been practiced at the commercial
scale with undisputable technical and operational success for
decades in the North Sea, North America, Australia, and
elsewhere. 25 , 26  To overcome public and political acceptance
issues especially in continental Europe and as part of its 2050
climate action, the European Union (and Norway as well) is

preferred solution being most likely case- (and country-)
speci ﬁ c.
Finally, with reference again to the synthesis of MeOH, a
recent paper compares the CCU approach with the BAU
solution based on fossil-C, in terms both of planetary
boundaries, that is, environmental performance, and of
costs. 32  The authors draw conclusions about how much
“ green ” hydrogen costs have to drop to make the CCU
solution commercially attractive. They acknowledge that there
is an alternative CCS route, but for whatever reason they
declare it is beyond their paper ’ s scope.
2.4. Scope of the Work and Structure of the Paper.
This work aims at ﬁ lling the gap by providing a general
qualitative comparison among the CCS, CCU, and BIO routes
for a generic chemical product (see section 3 ), as well as a
speci ﬁ c quantitative comparison for the case of MeOH (see
section 4 ). We have chosen MeOH because of (i) the
plethora of reliable data about the di ﬀ erent synthesis routes,
(ii) its important role as commodity chemical and fuel (global
demand is of the order of 100 million metric tons per year),
and (iii) its potential role as a platform molecule, on which a
“ methanol economy ” could be based. 33 , 34

planning to establish CO 2 storage hubs in the North Sea that
will enable European emitters to capture CO 2 and to exploit
centralized storage volumes to sequester it. 27  Second, CO 2
storage is an essential component of negative emissions
technologies (NETs) based on BECCS (bio-energy with
carbon capture and storage) and DACCS (direct air capture
with carbon storage); humankind might need NETs in the
second half of the century to compensate for an overshoot in
global temperatures and to cope with unavoidable positive
emissions, for example, from aviation and shipping and from
agriculture. 28  The IPCC projects a cumulative need from 100
to 1000 Gt CO 2 between now and 2100 (today ’ s CO 2
emissions are of 35 − 40 Gt CO 2 /y). 2  In the case of BECCS,
biomass can also be used to generate heat and power,
followed by CO 2 capture and storage, whereas in the case of
DACCS only the environmental service of removing CO 2
from the atmosphere is ful ﬁ lled, to a net extent that depends
on the carbon intensity of the energy utilized as input. Thus,
concluding, if one believes that climate change is an issue and
that negative emissions technologies will have to be
implemented, one must support as an obvious consequence
a timely and widespread deployment of CO 2 storage.
2.3. A Thorough Comparative Assessment of the
Three Alternative Routes Is Missing. For all the three
alternatives, identi ﬁ ed for simplicity with the acronyms CCU,
BIO, and CCS, how to enable net-zero-CO 2 emissions
production of chemicals and delivery of the corresponding
societal service has already been described elsewhere in the
literature. 18 , 29 − 32  Nevertheless, and strangely enough, to the
best of our knowledge, there has been no thorough attempt to
compare them in a quantitative manner.
A SAPEA report from 2018 compares them qualitatively, 30

and highlights an important di ﬀ erence. If in the CCU
approach the CO 2 used as feedstock for the production of
chemicals is captured from a point source where it originates
from fossil-C, then there is at maximum a single reuse of the
fossil carbon atom, thus potentially reducing emissions by
50%. Although this is undoubtedly a major improvement with
respect to the BAU (business as usual) situation, it is by no
means a solution compatible with a net-zero-CO 2 emissions
constraint.
The same point is made with reference to the synthesis of
methanol (MeOH) by others. 29  Here, the authors highlight
also how the environmental performance of CCU is critically
linked to the carbon intensity of the electricity grid, because of
the large amount of electricity needed to make the hydrogen
that reacts then with CO 2 to synthesize MeOH. 29  They
compare CCS and CCU with BAU in terms of the carbon
footprint (CO 2 emissions per unit MeOH produced), but do
not include the direct capture of CO 2 from the atmosphere
after MeOH use, that is, they do not operate in the net-zero-
CO 2 emissions framework.
Bardow and co-workers perform a cradle-to-grave analysis
of CCU for the production of the 20 chemicals that yield 75%
of the carbon emissions of the chemical industry. 31  They
conclude that CCU has the potential to drastically reduce the
chemical industry ’ s GHG emissions, but with an ensuing
massive increase in the material ﬂ ows and in the electricity
requirements (under the condition that the carbon intensity of
power generation be indeed very low, i.e. a condition that only
a handful of countries ful ﬁ ll at the moment). Importantly, they
underline that a net-zero-CO 2 emissions chemical industry
will require that all three approaches contribute, with the

The comparison will be based on technical performance,
not on costs, because of the higher level of robustness of the
technical key performance indicators with respect to the
economic ones. All qualitative and quantitative considerations
will be based on the net-zero-CO 2 emissions framework,
advocated in the seminal paper by Davis et al. 35  on net-zero
emissions energy systems. Such framework has also been used
recently to study the technical performance of C-free and C-
rich synthetic fuels (namely hydrogen and ammonia, and
methane and methanol) in power − fuel − power and power −
fuel − propulsion applications, for which the input power is
assumed to be coming from carbon-free renewables. 36  We
argue that implementing the net-zero-CO 2 emissions frame-
work avoids considering solutions that might reduce emissions
in today ’ s world, but will never be part of the net-zero
emissions world of the second part of the century.
We will also apply a simpli ﬁ ed system analysis of the
di ﬀ erent technology chains, very much in the spirit of recent
papers. 30 , 36  We fully agree with the methodology behind this
approach, that considers the simpli ﬁ ed analysis as a
complementary tool with respect to a comprehensive life
cycle analysis (LCA). Such a simpli ﬁ ed system analysis is very
useful in the scope of a conceptual evaluation of systems,
particularly of systems involving new technologies, on which
the large amounts of detailed data needed by LCA is not
readily available. After the sanity check provided by this
analysis, a full-blown LCA can be performed on speci ﬁ c,
promising solutions and systems.
In the case of MeOH, we are able to calculate power and
heat requirements of the di ﬀ erent technology chains, as well
as land use and CO 2 storage space required (in the case of
CCS). The former set of indicators allows for a straightfor-
ward comparison among the three technology chains, whereas
the latter set of indicators does not. Within this context, we
also present a quantitative comparison of the di ﬀ erent
technology chains within a net-positive-CO 2 emissions
world, by computing the CO 2 emissions resulting from the
three routes as a function of the carbon intensity of the
available electricity. Although a straightforward ranking of the
CCS, CCU, and BIO routes is thus not possible, our analysis
underlines clearly their pros and cons.

captured from point sources (PSC, point source capture)
available along the technological chain. This will depend on
the characteristics of the product synthesis and of the end-of-
life processes. Finally, any optimal combination of capture
from point sources and air is possible. Whenever point source
capture is employed, and given that 100% CO 2 removal is
hardly feasible, additional, yet limited, DAC capacity would be
required to comply with the net-zero-CO 2 emission scenario
(see Figure 2 below illustrating the methanol case for a clear
illustration of these two alternatives). As for the energy
requirement for the CO 2 capture from concentrated source,
this could be met by additional fossil fuel consumption, reuse
of waste heat if available from the synthesis, and renewable
energy sources (with the latter being considered here). It is
important to note that such routes are viable today in the
form of commercial technologies, with costs that range from
few tens of $/t CO 2 for capture from concentrated sources to
few hundreds for capture from air. 38

Four routes for the production of a carbon-based product that
delivers the societal service under consideration are illustrated
in Figure 1 .
The ﬁ rst route (from the left-hand side of the ﬁ gure)
represents the current route, BAU, for which a fossil fuel
provides the carbon atoms, (part of) the hydrogen atoms, and
the vast majority of the energy required for the product
synthesis (electricity might be imported from the grid or
cogenerated locally). This route yields net-positive-CO 2
emissions into the atmosphere over the product lifetime,
which is typically signi ﬁ cantly shorter than any climate-
relevant time-scale. In such a chain, the bulk CO 2 emissions
are due to the product synthesis, and to the end-of-life
disposal of the carbon content in the product as gaseous CO 2
or other GHG (e.g., via combustion or decomposition).
Additional emissions, yet in most cases minor when compared
to the product synthesis and disposal, are due to the fossil fuel
extraction and preparation (as indication, the global volume-
weighted carbon intensity of crude oil upstream is 10.3 g CO 2 eq /
MJ 37 ).
All the other technology chains illustrated in Figure 1 are
compatible with the net-zero-CO 2 emissions framework.
The second route shown (CCS-DAC) still relies on
utilization of fossil fuels, but in this case all CO 2 emissions
produced along the chain (i.e., product synthesis, end-of-life
disposal, and any other CO 2 positive processes) are
compensated by recapturing the corresponding carbon
amount from air (DAC, direct air capture) and permanently
storing it underground. The energy requirement in the chain
is provided by renewable energy sources for the product
synthesis and DAC. Notably, the latter can be geographically
decoupled from the product plant, and placed where adequate
renewable sources and CO 2 underground storage volumes are
best available. As an alternative, which for the sake of
simplicity is not shown in Figure 1 , CO 2 emissions can be

In the third route shown in Figure 1 , labeled CCU-DAC,
CO 2 is extracted from the atmosphere via DAC and converted
into the targeted carbon-based product. This requires parallel
production of H 2 , which provides the hydrogen atoms found
in the ﬁ nal molecule as well as the energy for the product
synthesis and CO 2 activation. As for CCS-DAC, point source
CO 2 capture and any combination with DAC is possible
depending on the product end-of-life type of disposal, and on
the product synthesis process. In order for CCU-DAC to be
compliant with the net-zero-CO 2 framework, all energy needs
along the chain must be provided by carbon-free renewable
sources, which includes electricity supply as well as additional
hydrogen supply for all medium/high temperature processes,
for example, CO 2 activation.
The last route shown, labeled BIO, relies on the use of
sustainable managed biomass as carbon and feedstock to the
product synthesis. Indeed, such chain captures CO 2 from air
via photosynthesis during the biomass growth, thus resulting
in a net-zero-CO 2 emissions chain. Here, the energy need of

the process is met via additional biomass input, and via
renewable electricity.
3.1. Qualitative Assessment of the Di ﬀ erent Routes.
First, the four di ﬀ erent routes can be qualitatively compared
from a few key perspectives.
Global CO 2 Footprint. With the exclusion of BAU, all other
routes illustrated in Figure 1 are CO 2 neutral. However, it can
be noted that the CO 2 balance varies when considering a
cradle-to-gate or a cradle-to-grave analysis: Clearly, in order to
correctly keep track of carbon emissions, the product disposal
must be included in the analysis.
Use of Resources. The four chains make use of several
resources as input, yet they di ﬀ er signi ﬁ cantly both in type
and amount when considering the di ﬀ erent routes. Especially,
we can recognize four critical categories:

- Fossil carbon: while there is currently broad consensus
that fossil fuels are not scarce on earth, the continuous
use of fossil fuels, even in a net-zero-CO 2 mode, poses
questions regarding the environmental impact of such
extraction activity, for example, with regards to non-
CO 2 greenhouse gases and to change in local
ecosystems, and the societal acceptability of such a
chain. Therefore, while CCS-DAC is the only route
capable of timely making the chemical industry as is
CO 2 neutral (especially when pursuing a global average
temperature increase of 1.5 ° C), it also entails the
continuous use of a controversial resource. Moreover,
there exists a systemic ﬁ nancial risk associated with the
continuous use of fossil fuels within a society on track
to limit global warming to 1.5 ° C: decrease in
consumption and sell-out of shares are likely to make
coal, oil, and gas reserves nonviable, that is, “ stranded
assets ” . 40 , 41  On the other hand, and especially for
countries with ine ﬃ cient state-owned fossil fuel
industries, the continued use of fossil resources in a
carbon-neutral mode could limit the disruption arising
from the possible or needed reconversion of jobs in the
oil and gas and coal sectors.

- Water: undoubtedly, water scarcity will become more
and more severe as climate change progresses. In all
four chains described above water is of key importance
for di ﬀ erent process units: from cooling ﬂ uid and H 2
provision via steam reforming and water gas shift (fossil
fuel-based routes), to feedstock for electrolysis (CCU),
and to feedstock for biomass growth (BIO). Therefore,
though beyond the scope of this work, a detailed water
balance must be drawn when comparing the di ﬀ erent
routes for a speci ﬁ c geographical location.

- Land use: the land use is primarily proportional to the
e ﬃ ciency of the processes providing the energy and
carbon feedstock. As fossil fuels are almost unbeatable
in terms of speci ﬁ c energy and carbon content (i.e., as
MJ/kg and MJ/m 3 ), the land use in the BAU route is
limited to the production plant premises (this might
change for land-intensive extraction processes, as for tar
sands and, to a certain extent, fracking). When
considering the CCS-DAC route, the land use require-
ment is increased by the need of providing renewable
energy to the DAC process and by the large amount of
air to be processes by the DAC. Moreover, this route
would imply the use of subsurface for CO 2 storage,
which anyhow would (i) bene ﬁ t of a large storage
potential, estimated in 10,000 Gt CO 2 worldwide, 2 , 39  (ii)
not require a large volume with comparison to the
accessible subsurface, thanks to the high density (600 −
700 kg/m 3 ) at which CO 2 is stored, and (iii) not
compete with other useful uses of the pore volume.
Compared to the ﬁ rst two routes, the land use increases
signi ﬁ cantly for the DAC-CCU, and dramatically for the
BIO route. In the former, signi ﬁ cant land must be
provided to arti ﬁ cially exploit wind and/or sun-based
energy for green H 2 production (as a rule of thumb, the
area is 20 times the area for renewable energy-based
DAC separation). In the latter, land is used to harvest
biomass; this must cope with the low photosynthesis
e ﬃ ciency and with the fact that the global carbon
budget stored in biomass must stay constant over time
(or possibly increase via reforestation).

- Scarce materials and minerals: here, two di ﬀ erent classes
can be recognized. On the one hand are those materials
that can be considered scarce because of the lack of
production capacity (e.g., new CO 2 capture solvents,
electrodes for PEM electrolyzers), and on the other are
those that are a-priori scarce or di ﬃ cult to mine on
Earth (e.g., platinum, rare metals). While the ﬁ rst
category can be tackled via capacity expansion, the
second might result in price peaks and in geopolitical
tensions. Therefore, care must be taken in designing the
right combination of renewable carbon-free energy
sources (e.g., PV vs wind) and in limiting the
requirement of precious metals and rare materials in,
for example, catalysts. From this perspective the CCU-
DAC route is the most exposed to consumption of
scarce materials and minerals.

Competition with Other CO 2 Reduction Measures. To
reach a net-zero-CO 2 emissions world a combination of
di ﬀ erent measures in all sectors of the society will be
required. 42  Within this framework there will be competition
for the sustainable use of resources, such as low-carbon energy
and materials for PV panels and DAC plants, across several
sectors. From this perspective, all routes producing a carbon-
rich product using DAC will prevent the use of DAC as
negative emission pathway (i.e., DACCS), especially in a
scenario where the value of such service is clearly recognized
and monetized. Moreover, the CCU-DAC pathway requires a
substantial amount of carbon-free renewable energy, especially
to power water electrolysis for the production of H 2 : It is of
paramount importance that such a route does not compete
with or hamper the decarbonization of the electricity grid. In
fact, as quanti ﬁ ed below for methanol, for the CCU-DAC
route to be net-zero-CO 2 emissions the carbon footprint of
the electricity grid must be zero. As for the BIO route, several
sectors regard biomass as the holy grail for an easy switch to a
sustainable system, including, for example, fuel production for
aviation and chemicals. 43 , 44  Moreover, the deployment at scale
of negative emission technologies largely rely on bioenergy
coupled with CCS (BECCS). However, all these will have to
come to grips with a limited availability of sustainable
biomass.
Need of a Common CO 2 Network. In a net-zero-CO 2
emissions world where multiple chains based on the CCU,
CCS, or BIO approaches are deployed at large scale, a CO 2
network will be needed. In fact, CO 2 will be collected from

large scale point sources or absorbed from the atmosphere at
multiple locations. It will be transported over short and long
distances using trucks, trains, barges, ships, pipelines. It will
thus be conveyed to diverse CO 2 sinks, namely either
permanent sinks in CO 2 underground storage hubs (such as
the Northern Lights CCS project 27 ), or temporary sinks in
locations where CO 2 is used to manufacture C-rich products
and materials. It is therefore obvious that such a CO 2 network
infrastructure, which is not existing today, will be shared by
the three technology chains discussed in this paper. In
thinking of such a network, two challenges coexist, namely on
the one hand the optimal con ﬁ guration of the relevant
infrastructure when at full scale, and on the other hand the
most e ﬃ cient way to develop such an infrastructure during the
transition period.

##### 4. THE CASE OF METHANOL PRODUCTION

synthesis from CO 2 and H 2 have been previously
published; 45 − 50  hence, the wealth of data available allows for
a meaningful comparative assessment of the chains illustrated
in general in Figure 1 and for the speci ﬁ c case of MeOH in
Figure 2 . While a detailed assessment of the proposed systems
requires a comprehensive life cycle analysis, we adopt the
simpli ﬁ ed framework introduced above to provide useful
insights for the general comparison of CCS, CCU, and BIO
routes for methanol production. Note that this implies
neglecting the energy consumption and the CO 2 emissions
associated with the transport of CO 2 and with the building
process of the technologies of interest.
4.1. Quantitative assessment of net-zero CO 2
emissions routes for MeOH production. In Figure 2 we
illustrate the six technology chains considered, all delivering
the speci ﬁ c societal service provided by one unit of MeOH
(one ton of MeOH is used here as functional unit for our
analysis). They consist of several building blocks, which are
described in the following and whose characteristics are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2 .

Let us apply the qualitative framework presented above to the
case of methanol (MeOH), which is one of the major target
products in studies of CO 2 conversion or CO 2 capture and
utilization. 32 , 36  Detailed process simulations of MeOH

CCU technology chains. DAC can be deployed either in
combination with PSC or alone. In the former case, that
is, CCS- and CCU-PSC, the DAC unit is used to
capture the 10% of CO 2 that is not captured via PSC. In
the latter case, that is, CCS- and CCU-DAC, the entire
CO 2 emissions are captured via DAC. Here, the entire
amount of CO 2 generated is assumed to be emitted to
the atmosphere in a distributed fashion and has to be
captured back from there (i.e., at a concentration of
about 400 ppm). 56 , 57  The DAC unit is modeled as
presented by Sutter et al. 36  and requires 0.35 MWh e and
1.75 MWh t to capture one ton of CO 2 . The electricity
consumption is due to the capture process (0.25
MWh e /t CO 2 ) and to CO 2 compression (0.1 MWh e /
t CO 2

58 ). Similar to PSC, both electricity and heat are
provided by carbon-free electricity. A land use factor of
0.049 m 2 /(t CO 2 /a) is considered for the installation of
the DAC facilities. 36

Some of these blocks are common to all chains, for
example, the use of MeOH, while others are peculiar of
speci ﬁ c chains, for example, the carbon capture processes.
- MeOH use . This block (gray block in Figure 2 ) is
common to all technology chains. It is modeled through
a simple carbon balance to avoid considering speci ﬁ c
uses of MeOH (e.g., fuel for power or propulsion
purposes), hence resulting in 1.37 ton of CO 2 emitted
per ton of MeOH used. 29  Note that this approach
allows avoidance of the calculation of the e ﬃ ciency
characterizing speci ﬁ c uses of MeOH, which would not
improve the scope of the present analysis.
- MeOH production . Di ﬀ erent production processes are
considered for the di ﬀ erent con ﬁ gurations.
More speci ﬁ cally, the BAU and CCS routes adopt a
conventional production plant (yellow block in Figure
2 a,c,e), which uses 0.56 ton of fossil carbon and 0.15
MWh of electricity (MWh e ) to produce one ton of
MeOH. 45

- The captured CO 2 is sent to the storage facility and
stored underground in the CCS route, whereas it is
conveyed back to the MeOH production plant in the
CCU route.
- H 2 production . This is only present in the CCU route to
provide the H 2 necessary for the synthesis of MeOH.
Here, H 2 is supplied via an electrolyzer (orange block in
Figure 2 d,f), which uses carbon-free renewable elec-
tricity. A conversion e ﬃ ciency of 70% is considered
(hydrogen LHV), thus resulting in 47.6 MWh e /t H 2 . 29

- Managed biomass growth . This block (light green block
in Figure 2 b) is present in the BIO route only, where
the CO 2 produced by the production and use blocks is
uptaken and removed from the atmosphere during the
biomass growth. The value of biomass uptake is that
required to meet the carbon balance, namely 1.55 t CO 2 /
t b . A land use factor of 1000 m 2 /(t b /a) is considered for
the managed biomass growth installation. 36 , 59 , 60

- CO 2 storage . This block (brown block in Figure 2 c,e) is
present in the CCS route only, in which the captured
CO 2 is sent to a storage site. We consider underground
CO 2 storage with an available storage factor of 4%, 25 , 26

for which CO 2 has a density of 700 kg/m 3 .
- Carbon-free electricity from renewable energy sources
(RES) . For the time being, we assume that the energy
required by the MeOH synthesis and by the capture
processes is supplied by carbon-free solar electricity,
which allows achieving net-zero-CO 2 emissions for the
CCS and CCU routes (we neglect the energy required
for the managed biomass growth). The solar facilities
produce electricity with a conversion e ﬃ ciency of
17%. 61  This electricity is used to supply the heat
required by the capture processes via heat pumps, which
are characterized by a coe ﬃ cient of performance of 4. 61

The production plant adopted by the CCU routes
(red block in Figure 2 d,f) is modeled as presented by
Perez-Fortes et al., 45  and uses 1.46 ton of CO 2 , 0.2 ton
of H 2 , 0.17 MWh of electricity, and 0.44 MWh of heat
(MWh t ) to produce one ton of MeOH.
Finally, the methanol production plant of the BIO
route (dark green block in Figure 2 ) is modeled based
on the work of Hannula and Kurkela 51  and on
discussion with industry experts, 52  and uses 2.5 ton of
biomass (wood chips, with a lower heating value of 17
MJ/kg), 0.8 MWh e , and 1 MWh t to produce one ton of
MeOH.
The required thermal energy is provided via heat
pumps that use carbon-free electricity for the CCS and
CCU chains, whereas it is provided by biomass for the
biomass route (already accounted for in the amount of
biomass entering the production block). For all
processes, the required electrical energy is provided by
carbon-free electricity. This results in no indirect
emissions, while 0.7, 0.09, and 2.5 ton of CO 2 are
directly released per unit MeOH by BAU and CCS,
CCU, and BIO technology chains, respectively.
- Point-source carbon capture (PSC) . The same PSC unit
(light blue block in Figure 2 c,d), is considered for the
CCS-PSC and CCU-PSC technology chains, in which
the CO 2 emissions due to the MeOH production and
use blocks are captured via a combination of PSC and
DAC processes.
The PSC unit is modeled as an amine-based CO 2
capture process with 90% removal e ﬃ ciency, which
captures CO 2 from a concentrated source (i.e., from a
ﬂ uegas with a CO 2 concentration of 5 − 15%). It
requires 0.94 MWh t /t CO 2 for the capture process and
0.1 MWh e /t CO2

A land use factor of 6.14 m 2 /(MWh e /a) is considered
for the installation of the solar facilities, resulting by
considering a solar productivity of 1000 MWh e per peak
MW per year. 62

53 − 55 for CO 2 compression (from 1 to
110 bar), which results in the energy consumption per
unit MeOH reported in Figure 2 . Both electricity and
heat are provided by carbon-free electricity, with the
former being supplied directly and the latter through
heat pumps. This results in no additional CO 2
emissions for the capture process and allows for a
net-zero-CO 2 emissions framework.
- Direct air capture (DAC) . The same DAC unit (dark
blue block in Figure 2 c,d,e,f) is needed in all CCS and

The input material and energy ﬂ ows, as well as the land use
associated with the di ﬀ erent routes are reported in Table 1 .
All assumptions made to perform such calculations are
summarized in Table 2 . The electricity and heat consumption
are further plotted in Figure 3 for the sake of illustration (the

Figure 3. Electricity consumption (left) and heat consumption (right) of the six considered routes. All routes, except the business-as-usual one
(BAU), lead to net-zero-CO 2 emissions thanks to CO 2 capture and to the use of carbon-free renewable electricity to satisfy both electricity and
heat consumption.

land use is not included in the ﬁ gure because of the very
di ﬀ erent values for the three routes).
Concerning electricity consumption (left-hand side of

The BIO route is characterized by an electricity
consumption of about 0.8 MWh e /t MeOH , which is similar to
the case of CCS-DAC, and by a heat consumption of about 1
MWh t /t MeOH , which is about one-third of that needed for the
CCS and CCU routes.
Such energy consumption translates into a higher land use
of the CCU route with respect to the CCS route (see Table
1 ). More speci ﬁ cally, the CCU land use is about 15 times
higher than that of CCS when adopting PSC, and about 6
times higher when adopting DAC only. Concerning the BIO
route, the land use is due almost entirely to the contribution
of the managed biomass growth, which requires 2500 m 2 /
(t MeOH /a). This is about 40 times higher than CCU and 400
times higher than CCS.

Figure 3 ), the CCU route is characterized by a value around
10 MWh e /t MeOH , which is about 25 times higher than the
CCS route when adopting PSC, and about 10 times higher
when adopting DAC only. This is mostly due to the
contribution of hydrogen production, which accounts for
about 95% of the total electricity consumption.
Concerning heat consumption (right-hand side of Figure
3 ), similar values around 3 MWh t /t MeOH are obtained for both
routes, with CCS consuming more heat than the CCU routes
because of the greater amount of CO 2 emitted by the MeOH
production process, that is, 0.7 versus 0.09 t CO 2 /t MeOH .

a In the work of Gonzalez-Garay et al., 32 which is not framed within a net-zero-CO 2 emissions world, heat is supplied via conventional fossil fuels.
Owing to our net-zero-CO 2 emissions constraint, we consider such fossil fuels to be replaced by H 2 in the case of DAC (heat required at high
temperature 64 ) and by heat pumps in the case of PSC (heat required at low temperature).

This is because of the higher e ﬃ ciency of capturing CO 2 from
concentrated sources versus capturing CO 2 from air.
This implies that the CCS route performs better than the
CCU one in terms of energy consumption and CO 2
emissions, with the maximum bene ﬁ t being achieved by
deploying a combination of PSC and DAC.
4.3. Discussion. Finally, let us discuss the most relevant
assumptions for the quantitative assessment, and compare
them with existing literature, namely, (i) the heat supply
technology, (ii) the energy penalties (electricity and heat) of
DAC, and (iii) the energy consumption of water electrolysis.
This implies focusing on the CCU and CCS routes, since the
BIO route is not a ﬀ ected by such assumptions and its speci ﬁ c
critical hurdle is the sustainable availability of land. The values
of the parameters of interest, as well as the resulting total
electricity consumption for the CCS and CCU routes, are
reported in Table 3 .

(i) Heat supply . While in this work heat is supplied via heat
pumps using carbon-free electricity, di ﬀ erent choices are
made in di ﬀ erent studies. More speci ﬁ cally, Sutter et
al. 36  developed a net-zero-CO 2 emissions framework
through which heat is supplied via H 2 boilers. In their
case, H 2 is ﬁ rst produced starting from carbon-free
electricity via water electrolysis and is then burnt in
boilers to supply heat. This results in a signi ﬁ cantly
lower e ﬃ ciency of the electricity-to-heat conversion
process, which is 4 in our work and around 0.6 in
theirs. 36  On the other hand, Gonzalez-Garay et al. 32

consider a di ﬀ erent DAC technology, that is, that
presented by Keith et al. 64  In such a process, the CO 2
regeneration is carried out via a natural gas-based
oxyfuel combustion, while in the DAC technology
considered here and in Sutter et al. 36  low temperature
heat is used. Note that while in the original
references 32 , 64  natural gas is used as fuel, for comparison
purposes within the boundaries of our net-zero-CO 2
emissions framework, we replace natural gas with H 2 in
calculating the values reported in Table 3 ; using H 2
boilers instead of heat pumps to satisfy the heat demand
results in higher values of the total electricity
consumption. This applies to all chains when this
choice is made for all technologies, 36  whereas it is
limited to the chains based on the DAC when this
assumption concerns the DAC technology only. 32

It is worth noting that such values cannot be compared to
the underground volume required to store CO 2 in the CCS
route, which is about 75 m 3 /(t MeOH /a).
It is also worth noting that the land quality needed for
renewable energy installations and for managed biomass
growth are going to be very di ﬀ erent. We believe that the
quantitative comparison makes sense, but the di ﬀ erence of the
type of land should also be kept in mind.
4.2. CO 2 Emissions of the Considered Routes for
Electricity with Carbon Emissions. So far, we have
considered carbon-free solar electricity to supply the energy
required by the MeOH production processes and by the CO 2
capture technologies. However, operating the investigated
technology chains with currently available electricity, which is
characterized by a di ﬀ erent carbon intensity depending on the
geographic location, would result in positive values of the CO 2
emissions. This is shown in Figure 4 , which reports the
amount of CO 2 emitted per unit MeOH as a function of the
carbon intensity of the available electricity.
The BAU route results in about 2 t CO 2 /t MeOH and is
essentially independent of the electricity mix. In this case, the
largest share of CO 2 emissions is due to the use of fossil
carbon to produce and use methanol, while the electricity
required for the production process, which is responsible for
the increase of CO 2 emissions, plays a minor role. In contrast,
the CO 2 emissions of the other routes increase with the
electricity carbon intensity, with those of CCU growing about
8 to 10 times faster than those of CCS and BIO. This is
proportional to the larger total electricity consumption
(including both electricity and heat requirements) of the
CCU route, which is mostly due to the electricity required to
produce hydrogen. As an example, consider the electricity
mixes of France (92 t CO 2 /MWh), Switzerland (127 t CO 2 /
MWh), and EU-28 (407 t CO 2 /MWh). 63  The CCU route emits
about 0.9, 1.2, and 3.8 ton of CO 2 more than the CCS route
per ton of produced MeOH (average of -PSC and -DAC
technology chains). Similar trends are observed for the CCS-
PSC and the BIO chains, since the greater heat demand of the
former is balanced by the greater electricity demand of the
latter.
For both CCS and CCU, the CO 2 emissions are higher
when adopting DAC only. More speci ﬁ cally, they grow about
1.9 (CCS) and 1.1 (CCU) times faster than those obtained by
deploying a combination of PSC and DAC (i.e., -PSC chains).

three are feasible and viable, because under speci ﬁ c
conditions they can be realized in such a way that CO 2
emissions to the atmosphere are net-zero.

(2) A thorough assessment of the pros and cons of di ﬀ erent
technology chains requires a systemic analysis, which
can be carried out in a simpli ﬁ ed manner ﬁ rst, to be
followed by a full-blown life cycle analysis (and cost
evaluation). When looking at the whole system, one
also realizes how many common elements the three
technology chains have.

(3) Among the CCS, CCU, and BIO routes there is no
clear winner, because each has its pros and cons, and
because some of the key performance indicators, for
example, land use, cannot be directly compared. We
interpret this observation in a positive manner, by
drawing the conclusion that under di ﬀ erent technical,
economical, and geographical circumstances one or the
other of the technology chains might be preferred. Of
course, all three routes perform worse than the business
as usual (BAU) route in terms of energy (heat and
power) and land penalties. However, this is the price to
pay to enable a net-zero-CO 2 emissions chemical
industry.

(ii) Energy penalties of DAC . Values of electricity and heat
consumption di ﬀ erent than those used in this work are
used in the paper by Gonzalez-Garay et al. 32  Again, this
is because they consider the technology presented by
Keith et al., 64  which features (i) a higher electricity
consumption and (ii) a lower heat consumption, with
heat required at higher temperature. Since the numbers
in Table 3 are calculated for a heat supply via H 2
combustion, overall this results in higher values of the
total electricity consumption for the chains based on
DAC.
(iii) Energy penalty of water electrolysis . Values of e ﬃ ciency
di ﬀ erent than those used in this work are found in the
paper by Gonzalez-Garay et al. 32  More speci ﬁ cally, they
use a more conservative value of 52.3 MWh e /t H 2 (64%
LHV e ﬃ ciency), while we use a more optimistic value
of 47.6 MWh e /t H 2 (70% LHV e ﬃ ciency). This explains
their higher value of total electricity consumption for
the CCU routes. It is worth noting that when
considering values of the electrolysis e ﬃ ciency close
to thermodynamic limit (around 80% LHV), a
reduction of total electricity consumption of about
10% only is obtained for the CCU routes; hence, the
considerations presented in this work remain valid.

Table 3 . Overall, our assumptions lead to more optimistic
values of the total electricity consumption for all technologies
and chains, especially concerning the DAC technology and the
CCU route.

(4) Key hurdles have been identi ﬁ ed for each of the three
net-zero-CO 2 routes. In a nutshell, these are (a) the
availability, accessibility, and acceptance of CO 2 storage
sites for the CCS route, but not their safety, which has
been extensively proven; 25 , 26  (b) the very high
electricity and energy demand (due to the need to
synthesize hydrogen via electrolysis and to energize
CO 2 ) for the CCU route, with the associated strict
requirement of very low carbon-intensity of the
electricity mix; (c) the availability of land for biomass
growth in the case of the BIO route, with the associated
risks of con ﬂ ict with other uses. On the other hand, it
would be wrong not to underline two big advantages of
the CCS route: (i) it can exploit the existing technology

##### 5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper provides a conceptual analysis of the three
technology chains that enable a carbon neutral chemical
industry in a net-zero-CO 2 emissions world, that is, in the
world that all future scenarios indicate that we need to reach
by mid of the century (see section 3 ). Such routes are based
(i) on the use of fossil fuels and current chemical processes
and infrastructure together with CO 2 capture and storage
(CCS route), (ii) on the use of captured CO 2 used as
feedstock together with “ green ” hydrogen in new chemical
processes (CCU route), and (iii) on the use of biomass grown
and processed speci ﬁ cally for the purpose of making chemicals
(BIO route). This paper also provides a quantitative
comparative assessment of the three routes for the production
of methanol (see section 4 ). Though parts of this comparison
had already been carried out and reported earlier, we are
convinced that our thorough and comprehensive technical
comparison is novel, timely, interesting, and useful. The
analysis of methanol production in section 4 allows
quanti ﬁ cation of, in the speci ﬁ c case, the qualitative comments
made in section 3 , without losing general relevance. In other
words, we are persuaded that similar results would be
obtained if other chemicals were considered instead of
methanol.
From the analysis reported here we can draw a few
important take-home messages.
(1) The chemical industry can indeed be defossilized, while
continuing to deliver the chemical products and the
services that are so essential to our life and activities.
Defossilization, as de ﬁ ned in the second paragraph of
section 2.2 , can be accomplished in three di ﬀ erent ways,
that is, following the CCU, CCS, or BIO approaches
discussed and comparatively assessed in this work. All
