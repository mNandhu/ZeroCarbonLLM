ABSTRACT: Technological and medical advances over the past few decades
epitomize human capabilities. However, the increased life expectancies and
concomitant land-use changes have significantly contributed to the release of
∼ 830 gigatons of CO 2 into the atmosphere over the last three decades, an
amount comparable to the prior two and a half centuries of CO 2 emissions.
The United Nations has adopted a pledge to achieve “net zero”, i.e., yearly
removing as much CO 2 from the atmosphere as the amount emitted due to
human activities, by the year 2050. Attaining this goal will require a concerted
effort by scientists, policy makers, and industries all around the globe. The
development of novel materials on industrial scales to selectively remove CO 2
from mixtures of gases makes it possible to mitigate CO 2 emissions using a
multipronged approach. Broadly, the CO 2 present in the atmosphere can be
captured using materials and processes for biological, chemical, and geological
technologies that can sequester CO 2 while also reducing our dependence on fossil-fuel reserves. In this review, we used the curated
literature available in the CAS Content Collection to present a systematic analysis of the various approaches taken by scientists and
industrialists to restore carbon balance in the environment. Our analysis highlights the latest trends alongside the associated
challenges.
# ■ **INTRODUCTION**

ecological consequences the international community adopted
significant CO 2 -emissions reduction targets (“race to zero” by
2050) in 2015 at the 21st Conference of Parties on Climate
Change. 8

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is a critical component for plant life and
thus animal and human life. Combustion of carbon-containing
fuels to CO 2 allows humans to live almost anywhere on Earth
and provides power for industrial production. However, as
shown in Figure 1 , rapid growth of atmospheric CO 2
concentrations has undesired consequences, including global
warming, where the past 40 years have seen temperatures rise
at a rate (0.18 ° C/decade) that is more than twice that (0.08
° C/decade) in the 100 years prior. 1  CO 2 emissions from
naturally pre-existing and anthropogenic activities outweigh
uptake and sequestration pathways, resulting in a cumulative
buildup of atmospheric CO 2 levels. Thus, global warming,
atmospheric CO 2 levels, and world population are inter-
connected. 2 − 4

Given these societal challenges and because CO 2 is nontoxic,
nonflammable, plentiful, and a renewable carbon source, it has
been utilized as a sustainable feedstock as part of multipronged
approaches to decarbonize the atmosphere via capture and
biological, chemical, and geological sequestration or storage.
Carbon or CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies are
focused on reducing the amounts of CO 2 released into the
atmosphere by separating it from other gases, compressing,
transporting and finally storing the captured CO 2 far away
from the atmosphere, avoiding any leakage back into the
ecosystem. 10 , 11  The high costs associated with these
technologies have limited large-scale annual capture and
storage capacity to only about 0.1% of global CO 2 emissions, 12

but this number is predicted to go up to 19% by 2050. 13  CO 2

Today, our global population is almost 8 billion and
atmospheric CO 2 levels are ∼ 417 ppm (ppm). 5  Land use
changes and fossil-fuels usage account for ∼ 40 billion metric
tons/year CO emissions globally as of 2021  6 , 7  In comparison

from the CAS Content Collection of journal and patent
publications spanning the years 2001 − 2021. We focus on
technologies capable of reducing global atmospheric CO 2
levels. The current global CO 2 emissions are at about 40
gigatons/year; therefore, a technology should have the
potential to sequester gigaton quantities of CO 2 each year. 15

We first provide an overview of publication trends by time,
country/region, and keywords. Then, the technologies,
methods, materials, and chemical substances involved in CO 2
separation, capture, sequestration and use are discussed and
their publication trends analyzed to provide an overview of
current developments in CO 2 mitigation strategies.

The CAS Content Collection is the largest human-curated
collection of published scientific knowledge, In this work,
about 18500 CO 2 capture and sequestration-related docu-
ments containing relevant terms in title, abstract, or CAS-
indexed areas were found with publication years between 2001
and 2021 (see the [Supporting Information](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c05070/suppl_file/ao2c05070_si_001.pdf) for method
descriptions of search strategy and terminologies). We chose
to use a sample of available documents rather than a
comprehensive set of documents in order to ensure that
trends in CCS research are accurately represented.

Figure 3 shows the annual publication volume related to
CO 2 capture and sequestration. Overall publication numbers
increased rapidly in the early 2000s, slowed down after mid-
2010s, and recently experienced rapid growth. The initial
steady increase can be attributed to the urgency of reducing
atmospheric CO 2 levels triggered by global efforts. However,
the absence of strong support in carbon capture and storage
projects evident in small investment and economic incentives
given to the CCS process compared to other technologies may
have been the cause of stabilizing publication numbers
afterward. Alternatively, we see an interdependence between
oil prices and climate policies; low oil prices are likely to make

in its purified or impure form (i.e., present in gas mixtures) can
be directly utilized as is (enhanced oil recovery, food and
beverage industries) or as a raw material for conversion into
other substances via geological (carbonates/soda ash, rock and
saline formations, minerals, coalbeds, aquifers, etc.), biological
(carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, secondary metabolites, etc.),
and chemical (carbon monoxide, alkanes, alcohols, alkenes,
acids, etc.) processes via carbon or CO 2 Capture and
Utilization (CCU) technologies. 14  Figure 2 shows the carbon
cycle and human contributions to CO 2 emissions and
potentially useful technologies for capture and sequestration
of CO 2 .

trends in CO 2 capture and sequestration research utilizing data

the expenses of CO 2 capture technologies difficult to tolerate,
even with the use of captured CO 2 in enhanced oil recovery to
offset capture costs. It can also be seen from Figure 3 A that
most of the documents are journal publications. Patent
publications only account for ∼ 10% in this document pool,
whereas on average, patents account for a third of the total
documents in the CAS Content Collection within similar time
frame, suggesting a relatively small commercial interest in this
research topic. 16  However, the distinct count of concepts being
introduced to this field showed a steep increase in the last 10
years, especially in journal publications ( Figure 3 B), suggesting
new ideas or methods being tested.
We also grouped the publications according to the country/
region of the first author affiliated organization (journal
publications) or the country/region of the patent assignee
(patent publications). Figure 4 shows that the same ten
countries/regions are responsible for the largest numbers of
both journal and patent publications. Publication trends over
the past 20 years show that China has steady growth in both
journal and patent publications, while India shows similar

growth in journal publications; these increases may be driven
by the increasing CO 2 emissions in both China and India
( Figure 5 ). In CCS literature, the United States shows a small
peak in the years of 2013 and 2014 and constant publication
numbers since 2015. It is clear that researchers from China are
driving publication trends in CCS, as removing articles from
China-based authors showed publication numbers remaining
roughly constant from 2015 to 2019 before increasing in 2020
and 2021 ( Figure 6 ).
# ■ **CARBON CAPTURE PROCESSES** In this section we focus on the methods and materials used for
CO 2 capture and separation from other gases in industrial
settings. Annual volumes of related publications from 2000 to
2021 are shown in Figure 7 , where the pattern is similar to that
for total publications related to CO 2 sequestration and
utilization ( Figure 3 A). Publication numbers were low prior
to 2007, increased sharply afterward, peaked in the early 2010s,
and stabilized afterward. The publication trends for CO 2
separation and capture ( Figure 7 ) are more abrupt than the

overall publication trends shown in Figure 3 A but likely
originate from similar causes. CO 2 capture and separation
technologies are closer to implementation than other CO 2
sequestration research and are more sensitive to economic
incentives and oil prices, consistent with the observed

publication trends. This section will begin with an introduction
to carbon capture systems (industrial setting for flue gas
handling), followed by reviews of capture methods (physical/
chemical processes and materials used).
**Carbon Capture Systems.** The removal of CO 2 from
power plant flue gases, the single largest source of human CO 2
emissions, has been a major focus of carbon dioxide capture
research. 17 − 19  The three most widely studied techniques are
postcombustion capture, precombustion capture, and oxy-fuel
combustion capture.
_Postcombustion Capture._ Most thermal power plants
generate electricity by burning fuel (most often pulverized
coal or natural gas) in air to release its thermal energy. The
heat boils water into steam which propels a turbine to generate
electricity; the combustion generates CO 2 and water vapor,
which, along with nitrogen from the air, are major components
of the flue gas. Postcombustion capture, the most popular
method, removes CO 2 from this gas mixture. It can be
straightforwardly retrofitted to existing power plants and is the
only commercialized carbon capture technique. The major
disadvantage of postcombustion CO 2 capture is that flue gas,
diluted with large amounts of nitrogen carried over from air,
has low pressure and low CO 2 concentration, making the
separation difficult and energy intensive.
_Precombustion Capture._ Precombustion capture is carried
out in power plants where fossil fuels are utilized differently. A
limited amount of pure oxygen is supplied, with or without
steam, to partially oxidize the fuel, producing synthesis gas
(syngas) comprised primarily of carbon monoxide, hydrogen,
and some carbon dioxide. This hot gas mixture contains
thermal and chemical energy, which are converted to electricity
through a steam turbine and a gas turbine, respectively. The
whole process, termed the integrated gasification combined
cycle (IGCC), is more energy efficient than combustion and
has simpler emission control. 20  If CO 2 capture is desired, the
cooled syngas, instead of going straight to the gas turbine, is
subjected to a water-gas-shift reaction to convert carbon
monoxide into CO 2 . The CO 2 /H 2 mixture then goes through a
separation unit to remove CO 2 and produce high-purity
hydrogen. The CO 2 /H 2 mixture has a simple composition, is at
high pressure, and contains CO 2 in high concentration, making
CO 2 separation much easier and less energy intensive than
postcombustion capture. However, retrofitting power plants
for precombustion carbon capture is much more difficult than
for postcombustion, and the production of pure oxygen for
partial oxidation is energy intensive.
_Oxy-Fuel Combustion Capture._ As the term implies, in oxy-
fuel combustion the fuel is combusted in pure oxygen instead
of air. The flue gas generated thus comprises predominantly
CO 2 and water vapor, which are easily separated by
condensation of water. The biggest challenge facing oxy-fuel
combustion is the high energy and cost required to produce
pure oxygen, which is used in much larger quantities than in
IGCC. The simplified schemes for the three CO 2 capture
techniques are shown in Figure 8 .
_Chemical Looping Combustion Capture._ In this emerging
CO 2 capture technology, treatment of a fuel with a metal oxide
partially reduces the latter while yielding a waste stream
containing only CO 2 and H 2 O. 21  The reduced metal oxide is
then oxidized with air to regenerate metal oxide, which is
returned to the fuel stream to complete the cycle. Chemical
looping may be viewed as a variant of oxy-fuel combustion in
which a metal oxide to metal transition acts as an oxygen

decreasing trend afterward. Chemical looping and direct air
capture, the newest emerging technologies, have low but
increasing publication volumes, consistent with their lack of
technical maturity.
**Methods for Capturing CO** **2** **from Flue Gas.** The most
studied methods for separating CO 2 from gas mixtures include:
(1) absorption into solvents, (2) adsorption into porous solid
adsorbents, and (3) filtration using membranes.
_Absorption._ Absorption of CO 2 may be carried out
chemically or physically. In chemical absorption, an alkali
absorbent solution is brought into contact with the gas mixture

carrier, obviating the expensive process for generating pure
oxygen. However, the chemical looping combustion of solid
and liquid fuels is much more complicated than the
combustion of gaseous fuels. In addition, the fluidized bed
reactors needed for combustion are complex, while the
processes and apparatus needed to move solids between the
combustion and reoxidation chambers are complicated and not
easy to optimize, making the technology expensive to use. The
above four CO 2 capture processes are compared in Table 1 .
**Direct Air Capture.** An alternative to CO 2 capture from
industrial plants is to capture it directly from the environ-
ment. 22  Direct air capture (DAC) can be carried out by
absorption or adsorption and has the potential to achieve
negative emissions if clean energy is used in the process
without generating extra CO 2 . 23  DAC plants are small and can
be placed where needed, such as near carbon storage, use, or
emission sites. 24 , 25  DAC projects have recently been strongly
supported by substantial funding, and 19 DAC plants have
been established worldwide. 26 , 27  Unfortunately, because of the
very low CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere (412 ppm), the
theoretical energy required to capture one ton of CO 2 from air
is several times that of capturing it from power plant
emissions, 28  and the current cost of capture is higher than
the price of CO 2 ; thus, DAC is not profitable today.
The numbers of publications related to the different
processes for CO 2 capture are shown in Figure 9 , where
postcombustion capture has a significantly higher publication
volume than all other processes. Publication volumes for the
three primary techniques all increased starting in the late 2000s
but peaked in the early or mid 2020s, displaying a generally

desorption by using glycine or lysine as promoters. 49  The total
journal and patent publication volumes for MEA, potassium
carbonate, and ammonia are shown in Figure 10 B. Both
K 2 CO 3 and ammonia have much lower journal publication
numbers than MEA; interestingly, there are more patents on
ammonia than on MEA.
Besides being studied as additives for other absorbents,
amino acid salts have also attracted attention as CO 2
absorbents themselves. They share the benefits of amines
and carbonates and have high absorption capacity along with
low toxicity and vapor pressure. 50  Their major disadvantage is
the easy formation of precipitates upon CO 2 absorption due to
their ionic nature, which complicates heat and mass transfer. 51

The resulting solution is then transferred to a regenerator
(reboiler) to release the CO 2 and recover the solvent.
Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the most widely used absorbent
and is the only one currently used in commercial
applications. 31  Other widely studied amines include diethanol-
amine (DEA), 32  methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), 33  pipera-
zine, 34  and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). 35  Amine-
based absorption is effective even for low-pressure streams with
low CO 2 concentrations, making it particularly suitable for
postcombustion capture. Their drawbacks include limited
thermal and oxidative stability, 36  the high thermal energy
required for solvent regeneration, 37  solvent evaporation, and
the corrosiveness of the absorbents. 38

For direct air capture (DAC), due to the low CO 2

concentration in the air, the leading absorbents used are
strong base solutions such as KOH or NaOH. 52  The use of
strong base absorbents means large amounts of energy are
needed to separate CO 2 from the absorbent, which exacerbates
the high cost of DAC. Mahmoudkhani et al. achieved
significant reduction in absorbent regeneration energy and
temperature by using sodium trititanate in place of calcium
hydroxide for causticization. 53  More recently, Shu et al.
reported an electrochemical process using an electrochemical
cell having a pH gradient, allowing for reduction in energy
consumption as well as simultaneous desorption and
regeneration. 54

Computer-aided molecular design has been conducted to
identify new structures or commercially available substances
that have not been explored as CO 2 absorbents. Salazar et al.
studied 50 amines that were prescreened using solubility and
boiling point data, selecting three that showed much lower
theoretical reboiler duty than MEA for postcombustion
capture. 55  Papadopoulos et al. modeled the solubility and
partial pressure of CO 2 and identified both new as well as
commercially available alternative amines that outperformed
MEA in overall absorption/desorption cycles. 56

The numbers of studies related to CO 2 capture using the
most popular amines are shown in Figure 10 . MEA has clearly
been the most studied absorbent over time, while the
publication volumes for most amines peaked in the mid-
2010s and then decreased.
Electrochemical solvent regeneration, where CO 2 is stripped
from the stream by electrochemically generated copper ions,
has been reported. 39 , 40  The processes were found to be more
energy efficient than thermal regeneration and can be carried
out at normal temperatures, thus minimizing solvent loss and
thermal degradation.
Ammonia is more stable, less expensive, and less corrosive
than other amines. 41  However, ammonia boils at − 33 ° C and
has a high vapor pressure, leading to rapid loss of absorbent
and deterioration of absorption capacity. Ammonia loss can be
mitigated by absorption of CO 2 at low temperature, 42  but the
absorption efficiency is compromised and the energy require-
ments for cooling decrease energy efficiency. Washing with
water or acids also improves ammonia retention 43 , 44  but
generates large amounts of wastewater or chemical waste.
Potassium carbonate acts as an absorber by reacting with
CO 2 to form potassium bicarbonate. 45  It shares most of
ammonia’s advantages while being nonvolatile, enabling CO 2
absorption at much higher temperatures. 46  Its major
disadvantage is a low absorption rate owing to poor CO 2
mass transfer. Amine and amino acid promoters that form
intermediates with CO 2 to facilitate the generation of
bicarbonate ions have been investigated. 47  Grimekis et al.
demonstrated that adding piperazine and MEA improved
absorption rates and CO 2 solubility at the same time, while
MDEA and glycine significantly impacted CO 2 solubility. 47 , 48

Li et al. reported enhancements in both absorption and

Physical absorption relies on physical dissolution of CO 2 as
the driving force. 57  The method is effective only at high
pressure and lower temperature and thus is much more
suitable for precombustion capture. However, physical
absorption using noncorrosive solvents is much less demand-
ing on equipment than chemical absorption and has been
practiced commercially. In addition, regeneration of physical
solvents is much less energy intensive since the dissolved CO 2
can be easily released through depressurization or moderate
heating. Commonly studied good CO 2 solvents include

pressure, lower flammability, good thermal stability, and
structural tunability. 64  However, physical properties such as
high viscosity combined with the high cost of ILs has limited
research into and commercial application of ILs. 65

_Adsorption._ In adsorption, porous solid adsorbents with
large surface areas bind CO 2 . Adsorption methods are
compatible with precombustion, postcombustion, and direct
air capture. The solid materials used are more stable, less toxic,
and easier to handle compared to liquid absorbents. The most
studied adsorbents include carbon (activated carbon, biochar,
charcoal, etc.), zeolites, and metal − organic frameworks
(MOFs), whose advantages and limitations are summarized
in [Table S1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c05070/suppl_file/ao2c05070_si_001.pdf) .
Recent research on adsorbents is focused on improving CO 2

The advantages and limitations of these solvents are
summarized in Borhani’s review. 62  All four solvents have
similar CO 2 solubilities at 25 ° C. In general, solvents with
higher molecular weights such as Selexol have lower vapor
pressures, leading to less solvent loss, but suffer from high
viscosities which impair mass transfer. Methanol, despite its
low cost, has a very high vapor pressure, necessitating
refrigeration and water washing to minimize solvent loss.
Propylene carbonate’s vapor pressure is higher than Selexol’s
but is still low enough to not require water washing. Because it
dissolves hydrogen poorly, propylene carbonate is selective for
CO 2 in precombustion capture. Chen et al. reported optimized
propylene carbonate solutions containing 2-methylimidazole
and ethylene glycol, which demonstrated significantly
improved CO 2 solubility and selectivity over hydrogen,
methane, and nitrogen. 61

The publication numbers related to different physical
absorbents are shown in Figure 11 , where methanol dominates

uptake and adsorption kinetics and enhancing dimensional
stability and reusability, as well as overcoming moisture
sensitivity (for zeolites and MOFs). 66 − 69  Optimizing adsorb-
ents for CO 2 uptake and selectivity does not necessarily
guarantee their applicability in real applications. The design of
temperature-swing (favorable for postcombustion capture) or
pressure-swing (favorable for precombustion capture) adsorp-
tion − desorption cycles, as well as different reactor config-
urations, all pose specific performance and stability require-
ments on adsorbents and can induce uncertainties in the
practical success of an adsorbent that performed well in the
lab. 70  More sophisticated modeling to efficiently screen the
numerous possible structures (particularly for MOFs) and to
predict their performance under complex processing con-
ditions is needed to increase the industrial application potential
of CO 2 adsorption.
Voskian et al. reported an electrochemical device for CO 2

adsorption, utilizing a polyanthraquinone − carbon nanotube
composite electrode, where CO 2 is captured via reductive
addition to the quinones and released by discharging. 71 , 72  The
electro-swing adsorption − desorption process is more energy
efficient than temperature-swing and pressure-swing cycles,
and the compact electrochemical cells are easy to fabricate and
scale up.
From the trends of publications adopting various adsorbents
( Figure 12 A), it can be seen that, while publications on zeolites
increased little after 2012, those related to carbon had steady
growth since 2007. Figure 12 B shows the total publication
volumes for the adsorbents, where the extremely small patent
number for MOFs is worth noting, albeit consistent with the
fact that related research is more focused on lab studies of new
MOF structures.
_Membranes._ CO 2 capture by membrane filtration is still an
emerging technology, mainly due to low gas permeabilities and

the other three absorbents in both journal and patent
publication volumes. The much lower document numbers
compared to those in Figure 10 B indicates physical
absorption’s lower popularity in comparison to chemical
absorption.
Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts with low melting points, enabling

alternative CO 2 solvents thanks to their very low vapor

consequent poor separation efficiencies. 73  Membrane-based
processes offer lower material costs and operational simplicity
and flexibility. Applications in precombustion and postcom-
bustion have both been widely studied. 74 , 75  For precombustion
capture (CO 2 /H 2 separation), H 2 passes through the
membrane to the other side (permeate side), leaving CO 2 at
the feed side, whereas in postcombustion capture (CO 2 /N 2
separation), separation is achieved by CO 2 preferentially
passing through the membrane. Separation mechanisms are
different depending on the membrane material and the gas
stream, including (1) size sieving, where the membrane’s pore
size is large enough to allow only the smaller gas molecule to
pass through, (2) surface diffusion, where the surfaces of the
membrane and pores are occupied by one gas through
preferential adsorption and become inaccessible to the other
gas, which therefore tends to stay at the feed side while the
more adsorbable gas moves to the other side, and (3) solution
diffusion, where the more soluble gas preferentially dissolves
into and then diffuses through the membrane. 76  While the first
two mechanisms work for porous membranes, the third occurs
during separation using dense membranes. The most studied
membranes can be classified into dense inorganic membranes,
porous inorganic membranes, and polymer membranes, as
summarized in [Table S2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.2c05070/suppl_file/ao2c05070_si_001.pdf) .
Most studied polymer membranes have been nonporous
(dense) membranes. However, emerging materials such as
conjugated microporous polymers, 77  polymers of intrinsic
microporosity, 78  and thermally rearranged polymers, 79  where
pores with controlled architectures are introduced to organic
polymers to improve CO 2 permeability and CO 2 /N 2
selectivity, have recently intrigued researchers. Polymer
membrane matrices with inorganic fillers, combining the
permeability and thermal stability of inorganic materials with
mechanical strength and processability of polymers, have also
shown promise. 80  Husna et al. prepared surface-modified UiO-
66-NH 2 by grafting an anhydride-terminated polyimide onto
the MOF. The modified filler had improved compatibility with
microporous polyimide matrices, and the blended membranes
demonstrated improved resistance to thermal aging and
plasticization, with CO 2 permeability and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity
surpassing the Robeson 2008 upper bound. 81

The publication trends of CO 2 capture using polymer
membranes and inorganic membranes, as well as their overall
publication volumes, are individually shown in Figure 13 . Here,
inorganic membranes surpass polymer membranes in both
journal and patent volumes, with remarkable growth in the
most recent years. It should be noted that the actual relative
prevalence of inorganic membrane studies is likely even
higher  in our analysis method, documents containing
polymer substances are deemed polymer-membrane-related,

**Comparisons of Methods and Concept Map Analysis.**
The three carbon capture methods (absorption, adsorption,
membrane) are compared in Table 2 .
The numbers of publications related to CO 2 capture using
absorption, adsorption, and membranes from 2001 to 2021 are
shown in Figure 15 . Here, absorption-related studies grew
substantially up to 2014 and then decreased, whereas
adsorption and membranes kept growing, albeit at slower
paces after 2010. Absorption has been studied in the patent
literature more frequently than adsorption. This observation is
consistent with absorption capture being relatively more
mature and closer to industrial applications. Membrane
separation, on the other hand, has much lower numbers for
all publication types compared to the other two techniques,
with patent publication volume several times lower than that of
absorption, consistent with it being an emerging technology.
To get insights into the prevalence of various CO 2 capture
methods (absorption, adsorption, membranes) studied in
different processes (postcombustion and precombustion), the
numbers of publications involving co-occurrences of the
corresponding terms are shown in Figure 16 , which suggest
that absorption has been studied the most for postcombustion
capture; for precombustion, on the other hand, the three
methods have almost equal shares of publications. This is to be
expected, given that precombustion produces streams with
high pressure and high CO 2 concentration that are relatively
easy for all separation methods, whereas the dilute CO 2 in
postcombustion’s CO 2 /N 2 stream favors absorption capture.

Once CO 2 is captured, it can be sequestrated and stored by
chemical or geological processes. CO 2 can also be sequestered
biologically, where carbon capture and sequestration are
accomplished in one step by living organisms. Recent research
progresses and publication trends in these methods will be
discussed.

Figure 18 , where the size of a node reflects the number of
times the corresponding concept occurred in the literature,
lines between every two nodes denote co-occurrences in the
same publication, and distances between nodes indicate the
frequencies at which the concepts co-occurred. One interesting
observation of the graph is that the concept “simulation and
modeling” is nearer to “absorption” than “adsorption”, the
latter instead being adjacent to common adsorbent character-
izations such as “pore size” and “surface structure”. The relative
material and operation simplicity for absorption capture likely
explains the prevalence of its modeling studies.
To help understand recent advancements in real applications
of carbon capture, some examples of existing or planned
operations of various capture methods are listed in Table 3 . As

research efforts focused on these biological systems have been
useful starting points to capture and sequester atmospheric
CO 2 . 12 , 15 , 98 − 101  Among the six CO 2 fixation pathways, the
reductive pentose phosphate pathway or the Calvin − Benson −
Bassham (CBB) cycle is the prevalent mechanism used by all
plants and algae, and most autotrophic bacteria. It is also the
most economically relevant pathway. 102  The other five
pathways are only present in a small number of bacteria or
archaea but nevertheless provide clues regarding the unique
environments in which the host organisms thrive. 103  Recent
efforts include engineering natural CO 2 fixation pathways in
non-native organisms 104 − 110  and engineering synthetic CO 2
fixation pathways into organisms. 111 − 115  An emerging new
concept combines microbial or algal cell factories with
electrochemistry to directly convert CO 2 . 116  Each approach
represents a promising line of investigation potentially leading
to the capture of gigaton quantities of CO 2 from the
atmosphere using natural biological hosts.
The most important challenge in employing photosynthetic
organisms for CO 2 capture lies in scaling up the process.
Because this involves the use of photobioreactors, open ponds,
or raceway ponds, scaling is hindered by large surface area
requirements, light requirements, low productivity, and
contamination possibilities. 117  Closed systems have been
proposed to overcome some of these limitations. 118

Recently, chemoautotrophic organisms including _Ralstonia_
_eutropha_ have been exploited for industrial applications due to
the CBB pathway that works with other pathways to sequester
CO 2 into bioplastics. 119 , 120  Furthermore, growth of this
organism at scale is simple and can be genetically
engineered. 121 − 129

emissions technologies have been developed, collectively
referred to as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage
(BECCS), for utilizing biomass (derived from biologically fixed
CO 2 ) as the energy source to capture and permanently store
CO 2 . 91 − 94  According to a report published in 2019, 95  five
facilities were utilizing this technology to capture ∼ 1.5 million
tons of CO 2 per year. However, a recent study predicts that
BECCS has a global potential to sequester up to 5.2 gigatons of
CO 2 . 95  The accelerated publication activity related to BECCS
over the last 6 years reflects these recent developments ( Figure
20 ).

In our curated list of publications, a significant number of
the biology-related publications ( ∼ 1600 out of ∼ 3900) had
identifiable terms in the abstract that could be linked to
photosynthetic organisms that use the CBB pathway for CO 2
fixation. 70% of these documents were published in the past
decade, suggestive of the recent focus on photosynthetic
organisms as the biological chassis of choice for CO 2 -
remediation studies ( Figure 21 ).
Bacteria and algae have rapidly become popular natural
biosystems of choice for CO 2 -sequestration studies due to their
extremely versatile metabolic capabilities, shorter lifecycles,
natural abundance, simpler growth requirements, and bio-
remediation potential and recent advances in genetic
manipulation capabilities ( Figure 22 ). Analysis of a subset of
our curated publication data set comprising 1343 journal
articles and 103 patents published between 2017 and 2021
indicated that it is becoming increasingly attractive to utilize
bacteria (mostly cyanobacteria) and algae as cellular factories
to sequester CO 2 because they can deliver a sustainable and
renewable platform to produce biofuels and high-value
products, wastewater and flue-gas remediation, and biomitiga-

carbon dioxide by chemical means into other materials such as
mineral carbonates or concrete which sequester carbon for
significant periods of time. CO 2 may also be converted into
reduced forms that can be used either as fuels or in the
manufacture of organic compounds or fuels which sequester
carbon dioxide for a shorter span.
_Concrete._ 4.4 billion tons of concrete is manufactured
worldwide, 143  which generates 7 − 8% of total human CO 2
emissions. 144  Concrete is made from water, cement, and rocks
or sand (aggregate). Cement is prepared from limestone
(calcium carbonate, CaCO 3 ), silica (SiO 2 ), iron ore, furnace
slag, and clay or slate. 145  Heating the mixture at high
temperature (1800 ° C) drives off carbon dioxide to generate
calcium oxide and calcium silicates. 60% of CO 2 emissions in
concrete manufacture comes from the decarbonation of
limestone, and the remaining 40% comes from the energy
needed to make the cement. 146  The calcium salts in powdered
cement react with water at the time of use to form a paste
containing calcium hydroxides and silicates, which adhere to
the aggregate and bind it into a single mass. 145  Over time, the
calcium hydroxides in concrete absorb carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, forming more stable calcium carbonates which
strengthen the concrete in the weeks after installation and over
the service life of the structure. Between 10 and 30% of CO 2
emitted during cement manufacture is reabsorbed during its
service life. 146  Carbon dioxide can also be added during
concrete pouring to incorporate more CO 2 and to increase
concrete strength. When concrete structures are demolished,
the concrete can be broken into aggregates which can be
recycled into new concrete, reducing concrete’s energy
consumption. Concrete wastes also absorb carbon dioxide
when left exposed to air, but only 1% of concrete wastes are
left exposed long enough to absorb significant amounts of
CO 2 . 146

tion of unwanted nutrients. 130 − 138  In one study, the authors
report the use of a novel metagenomic approach to analyze the
microbial communities in a cold subsurface high-CO 2 aquifer 2
fixation. Metabolic analyses at the organism level provided
insights into the biochemical cycles that support subsurface life
under the extreme condition of CO 2 saturation, which
predominantly involved the use of CBB and WL pathways in
tandem. 136

Reduction of CO 2 emissions can be obtained by improving
the efficiency of heating or using renewable energy sources for
cement production, by capturing CO 2 liberated in cement
manufacture, by carbonating concrete during installation, and
by allowing concrete wastes to remain exposed to air during
demolition. In addition, the recycling of concrete to form
aggregate may reduce the amount of cement needed for new
construction.
While concrete with no net CO 2 emissions is possible using
these advances, it requires most of the concrete service lifetime
to reach carbon neutrality and requires additional exposure of
concrete wastes to air to absorb CO 2 . 146  Carbonation
(addition of additional CO 2 to concrete while setting) is
unlikely to be used unless it increases concrete strength. 147 , 148

The use of concrete containing recycled aggregates may
require modified processes to install and may require more
expensive reinforcing materials or equipment, 149  although it
could reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 50% over new concrete
manufacture. Reducing the carbon footprint of concrete to
zero, however, is likely to require replacement of concrete with
other less carbon-intensive materials.
_Mineral Carbonation._ Mineral carbonation is the seques-
tration of carbon dioxide by forming stable metal carbonate
salts such as calcium and magnesium carbonates. 150  Sequestra-
tion can be performed either below ground ( _in situ_ ) or above
ground ( _ex situ_ ) using excavated minerals or metal salts.
Natural minerals containing calcium or magnesium oxides or
silicates such as wollastonite, olivine, and serpentine will
absorb carbon dioxide to form carbonates, as will ammonia or

Agricultural and forestry-related activities contribute sig-
nificantly to global CO 2 emissions. Due to their longer life
cycles and less amenability to genetic modification, CO 2
sequestration studies have not focused on the production of
bioproducts using CO 2 fixation in plants. Instead, CO 2
sequestration studies utilizing plants have focused on using
plant biomass, especially from energy crops, as sustainable and
renewable feedstocks for fermentation or biochar produc-
tion. 92 , 139 − 142  The overall publication trends for biological
CO 2 sequestration research indicate a growing interest in using
both natural and engineered biosystems and enzymes as
modules to capture CO 2 in innovative ways and convert it into
useful bioproducts, while reducing our dependence on fossil
fuel. It is notable that the past few years have seen a number of
these applications also integrate flue gas and bioremediation
into CO 2 -sequestration strategies.

other bases. Cheap wastes like steel slag, mining wastes such as
asbestos and nickel tailings, red mud from alumina
manufacturing, waste ash from sources such as incinerators,
and alkaline paper mill waste can also absorb CO 2 but may
require careful handling to prevent environmental contami-
nation.
Mineral carbonation can be performed directly (by treat-
ment of the dry or slurried minerals with carbon dioxide) or
indirectly (by conversion of the minerals to metal oxides or
hydroxides followed by carbonation). Direct carbonation in the
solid phase is limited by mass transport and is generally slow
unless high-surface-area absorbents are used. Carbonation of
minerals in aqueous solution is fast, but the dissolution of
minerals in water is slow. The solubility of minerals in water is
improved with acids, with hydrochloric or acetic acid being the
most common acids used, 150  but both acids are corrosive and
difficult or impossible to recover, increasing the costs of their
use further.
Mineral carbonation in some cases yields valuable materials.
Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), for example, has been
sold for $320/ton, while ultrapure calcium carbonate obtained
from carbonation can yield revenue of &gt;$9000/ton. 150 , 151  The
use of mineral-carbonation-derived carbonates, however,
would only sequester a small fraction of human CO 2 emissions.
_Ex situ_ mineral carbonation is likely to be an economical way
to sequester carbon dioxide if waste products (such as concrete
wastes or ash) are used as sources for metal carbonates. Most
indirect methods result in uneconomical carbonation. If
temporary sequestration is desired, the processes can be
made profitable by selling the carbonates (particularly pure and
ultrapure CaCO 3 ), but the market for carbonates is much
smaller than the scale that would be needed to capture a
significant fraction of human carbon dioxide emissions. _In situ_
methods are likely to be permanent methods for CO 2
sequestration, requiring minimal monitoring, and are econom-
ical, but sequestrated carbon dioxide is difficult or impossible
to reintegrate into the carbon cycle.
Technologies for geological and carbonate-forming methods
of CO 2 mitigation are likely more mature than those of other
chemical methods, and their costs and benefits are better
known. Of the keywords searched, the largest number of
documents discussed carbonation and mineralization ( Figure
23 ). References to carbonation are high but stabilize after
2011, while publications involving concrete for CO 2
sequestration follow a different pattern. The number of articles

on concrete is significantly smaller (though some concrete
articles may be included in documents discussing carbonation).
The lower level of interest in CaCO 3 than in other products of
CO 2 reduction may be evidence that _in situ_ mineralization has
attracted more interest than _ex situ_ mineralization.
The advantages and disadvantages of concrete carbonation,
as well as examples of their applications, are listed in Table 5 .
**Geological Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide.** Carbon
geosequestration relates to the process of injecting captured
carbon dioxide in deep porous geologic formations for long-
term storage. Captured CO 2 is compressed to elevated
pressures, converted into a supercritical fluid, and then
transported mostly by pipelines to the injection site. 152  Any
method used for geological storage of CO 2 should be able to
store it for a minimum of 1000 years with a leakage rate of less
than 0.1% per year.
Most estimates suggest that sufficient capacity exists to store
many thousands of gigatons (Gt) of CO 2 with only a small risk
of surface leakage in the following 10000 years. However, the
level of uncertainty of these estimates depends on the
formation (type and heterogeneity), the physical and chemical
processes accompanying CO 2 storage, the method being used
to determine the storage capacity, and the amount of available
data. 153 , 154  Several assessments of regional storage capacity
were conducted in Europe, China, Japan, Canada, and the
United States, yet making direct comparisons of their results
poses a problem due to their different underlying assumptions.
A method to better assess the CO 2 storage capacity worldwide
using globally available data sets was developed at MIT as part
of a larger project to use Integrated Assessment Models
(IAMs). 155  Their Economic Prediction and Policy Analysis
(EPPA) model estimated between 8000 and 55000 gigatons of
accessible geologic storage capacity for carbon dioxide using
current storage technology and that storage capacity is not a
limiting factor for carbon dioxide sequestration technology in
most regions even if stringent emissions reductions are
required.
The multiple requirements for site selection and successful
long-term CO 2 storage include (1) large capacity for storage of
the site, (2) high porosity and permeability in the reservoir, (3)
sealing caprock, (4) no fault planes near the site of injection
and low seismicity, (5) deeper than 800 m (about 2600 ft) so
CO 2 remains supercritical, (6) wellbore construction must
withstand long-term storage without compromising caprock
sealing capacity, 156  (7) easily accessible and monitored site,
and (8) subhydrostatic pore pressure. 157  Other considerations
include distance from CO 2 sources, population density and
local public acceptance, reliability of the storage operation,
legal accessibility, and the deployment model used. 158

Therefore, site options for geological sequestration of CO 2

include saline aquifers (porous reservoirs that contain
saltwater), 159  unmineable coal sites, shales and underground
depleted oil and gas reservoirs, 160 − 162  declining oil and gas
fields, 163 , 164  deep ocean waters, ocean floor or sedi-
ments, 165 − 167  and basalts or reactive rock formations. 168

CO 2 sequestration via solid gas hydrates (clathrates),
including storage in deep oceanic basins, sediments under
the sea floor, permafrost regions, methane hydrate reservoirs,
and depleted oil and gas fields partially saturated with water
has received increased attention in the past years due to its
potential storage capacity in the hundreds of thousands of
Gt. 167 , 169

**ACS Omega** **[http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf](http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf?ref=pdf)** Review

Deep saline aquifers are one of the best candidates for CO 2




storage because they are widespread, have large storage
capacity and ideal geologic properties, cannot be used for
human consumption or agriculture, and are isolated from the
environment. However, this process involves complicated
reactions among CO 2 , brine solution, and rock formations,
which could potentially affect the integrity and storage
efficiency of the well over the long term. 153 , 170  The efficiency
of trapping mechanisms and the movement of CO 2 through
the rock are strongly influenced by the CO 2 − brine − rock
wettability, the pressure and temperature, salinity, and
dissolved ions. 171  These trapping processes take place at
different rates and over many years, even thousands of years.
Several million tons of CO 2 were injected in saline
formations at several successful sites without issue: the Sleipner
and Snohvit projects in the North Sea, 172  the Quest project in
Canada using the Basal Cambrian Sands, 173  and the Mt. Simon
sandstone in Illinois. However, CO 2 injection was stopped at
one site in In Salah, Algeria, due to caprock fracture. These
projects indicate that CO 2 storage can be safely accomplished
if site selection, injection and postinjection operations, and
monitoring of the formation are rigorously evaluated and
implemented.
Besides these storage sites, CO 2 has been used extensively in
the past 40 years in enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
operations. 174  Typically, oil recovery increases by 10 − 15%
with EOR due to the solubility of CO 2 in oil. Up to two-thirds
of the injected CO 2 returns with the extracted oil and is usually
reinjected into the reservoir to minimize operating costs and
trap more CO 2 in the oil reservoir. The major drawback of
CO 2 storage using EOR is that today’s processes use naturally
occurring CO 2 (i.e., CO 2 that was previously underground)
due to its lower costs compared to CO 2 from anthropogenic
sources. Also, EOR projects are driven by the economics of oil
production and not by CO 2 storage and do not take advantage
of the full potential of the oil field to store additional CO 2 once
no additional oil can be extracted.
Similar to EOR, injection of CO 2 in tight gas sands, shales,
and coal seams is used to recover gas by displacement in a
process called enhanced gas recovery (EGR). 175 , 176  CO 2
storage in coalbeds is quite different from storage in oil and
gas fields or saline formations because the trapping mechanism
is by adsorption as opposed to storage in rock pore space.
Here, CO 2 is preferentially adsorbed onto the coal micropore
surface, displacing the existing methane. 177






The use of former fossil-fuel reservoirs for geosequestration
of CO 2 is attractive for many reasons. Rock reservoirs have
sufficient porosity and permeability to promote massive CO 2
volume injections, while oil and gas fields have a geological
barrier preventing upward migration and leakage of CO 2 into
shallower formations (proven by having stored hydrocarbons
for thousands to millions of years without appreciable leakage).
Meanwhile, the existing infrastructure and industrial setup
required for fluid injection can be utilized while the reservoirs
have already been geologically characterized, tested, and
monitored. Moreover, revenues from the produced gas/oil
can be used to help offset the current high costs of CO 2
sequestration. However, sequestering CO 2 while extracting oil
or gas is probably not the best way to mitigate the
environmental impact of CO 2 emissions.

of CO 2 were used to search the CAS Content Collection for
articles published between 2000 and 2021. According to the
extracted data, publications in this field increased gradually up
to 2013, while showing a decline in publications afterward
( Figure 24 ). Individual search terms showed similar trends

to lower density than its surroundings. CO 2 then spreads
laterally upon encountering caprock until it finds a gap. Fault
planes or fracture networks near the injection zone increase the
possibility of gaps, which would be potentially dangerous to life
in the surrounding area. CO 2 can potentially migrate into
shallow groundwater aquifers and compromise water quality by
releasing trace metals such as Sr, Zn, Co, and Ba and organic
compounds and/or change the water’s pH. 178 , 179

Figure 24. Publications related to geological storage of CO 2 from
2001 to 2021.

Deep coal seams that are not economically viable sources for
coal mining are generally used for sequestration of CO 2 .
Despite the many advantages of these sites, the injected CO 2
may chemically and physically alter the coal matrix and induce
its swelling and mobilization of polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons (PAHs) in the coal seam. 180  This mobilization of
PAHs may cause environmental issues, as PAHs are harmful
even at relatively low concentrations.
Induced seismicity is also a cause for concern, but it is not
expected to be a significant problem at geological CO 2 storage
sites if good engineering practices are followed. 181  The
measures generally taken to alleviate such effects consist of
fluid pressure management. For example, the injection of CO 2
is often conducted simultaneously with the coextraction of
formation brine in saline aquifers or extraction of oil/gas at
EOR/EGR sites, which can control the amplitude of the
overpressure in the reservoir and along faults. 182

except for “shale” and “clathrate”, whih displayed an upward
movement in the past 4 years, albeit in fewer numbers (data
not shown). Research on CO 2 storage in the form of clathrates
is still in development, with limited field data available, but
remains promising due to its potential for high volumes of CO 2
to be sequestered. While the “geological” term was used most
frequently in publications, as expected, the “aquifer”, “saline”,
and “brine” terms returned more publications than the rest of
the search terms, reflecting more interest in this specific
storage site ( Figure 25 ). This trend is replicated in a network

CO 2 pipelines pose a risk to local population and the
environment, as the presence of water and other impurities
within CO 2 may lead to operational problems related to
corrosion, gas hydrate, and ice formation and thus accidental
release of CO 2 . The exact levels of impurities will vary
depending on the source and capture process. Therefore, apart
from dehydration, gas treatment is required. The level of
impurities that can be tolerated will depend on the storage
method (or end use) and the transportation method. Other
challenges to CO 2 transport through pipelines consist of
pipeline design and maintaining the CO 2 in a supercritical
phase. 152

_ing._ Estimation and quantitative predictions of geological CO 2
storage security suggest geological storage is a secure, resilient,
and feasible option for reducing global climate change even
when applying worst-case values for each scenario. 183  CO 2
becomes safer and more secure the longer it stays in the
ground due to a range of physical processes, with
mineralization being the ultimate goal as trapping of CO 2
becomes permanent.
Best practices include monitoring of the injection process
and deploying surface and subsurface sensing technologies to
allow for risk assessment and mitigation of potential release of
CO 2 from wellbores, faults, and other migration pathways,
including CO 2 leakage from pressurized pipelines during
transport. 153 , 184  Monitoring allows leak detection with enough
warning to minimize the amount lost, and to quantify the leak
size. Simulations are also used in predicting the pressure
buildup in the formation, fluid flow, and geomechanical and
geochemical processes at the injection site. Research focused
on improving the fundamental understanding and modeling of
various aspects of geological storage and monitoring of CO 2
has been carried out over the past decade. 185

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires the EPA to
regulate underground injection activities to prevent contam-
ination of underground sources of drinking water (USDW).

indicated a strong affiliation with geological processes, as
expected, since numerical programs are used for assessment of
the storage capacity of the formation as well as for estimation

site to securely store CO 2 at a geological time scale is very
difficult to define. Moreover, uncertainties persist over the
liabilities of parties after the site is closed. Nevertheless, scaling
up and worldwide deployment and coordination of these
technologies and strategies should be the focus for upcoming
years. Since high-purity CO 2 streams are required for storage,
future research will also have to address ways to reduce the
cost of CO 2 capture and sequestration processes to be cost-
competitive with other carbon-free options.

injection wells. Class II wells are used to inject fluids related to
oil and gas production, including injection of CO 2 for EOR.
Class VI wells are used to inject CO 2 for geological
storage. 186 , 187  To protect potable water, EPA requires that
carbon storage project owners applying for permits define an
Area of Review (AoR) in which all risks to underground
sources of drinking water and the leakage potential of legacy
wells located within the AoR be identified. The AoR is an
estimate of the project footprint and is used to develop
monitoring plans to ensure protection of USDWs. 188  Either
the area of review is assigned a fixed radius (depending on the
well type) or it is defined using computational modeling as the
edge of the pressure front, whichever is larger. A suggested
possibility to reduce the uncertainty of long-term storage of
CO 2 and to decrease the impact of wells on the migrating CO 2
plume is to inject CO 2 below the maximum penetration of
most wells.
# ■ **CONCLUSIONS** The past two decades have seen dramatic growth in research
and application of CO 2 capture methods and subsequent
chemical, biological, and geological sequestration. Absorption
using amine solutions is the most mature CO 2 capture method
and the only one in large-scale applications, whereas persistent
research interest in absorption and membrane filtration is
evident despite challenges in industrial applications. Post-
combustion has drawn by far the most research interest owing
to its lower cost and relative ease to retrofit existing plants, but
it only favors absorption capture methods. Precombustion
methods, on the other hand, can accommodate any of the
capture methods because of the easier separation of CO 2 from
their gas streams and their flexibilities. Although overall
publication volumes related to CO 2 capture largely stopped
growing since the mid-2010s, the trends are not universal for
all specific fields, and continuous publication growth can still
be observed for some methods and materials.
Carbon Capture and Storage technologies are attractive to
industries such as fossil-fuel extraction and cement, steel, and
fertilizer production, as they can continue to function, and
CCS receives greater attention because of the ability to allow
business as usual. However, CCS is seen as controversial by
some environmental groups, as this technology seems to
perpetuate fossil-fuel exploration and risks delaying decarbon-
ization efforts.
The use of biomass via BECCS to capture carbon is likely a
rapidly deployable and effective method to sequester CO 2 at
low cost without major alterations in land use. Enzymes,
particularly RubisCO and carbonic anhydrase, provide an
intermediate strategy for CO 2 capture and an alternative to
physical and chemical capture methods. Of the chemical
methods, mineral carbonation (likely _ex situ_ ) may provide the
most expedient method to capture CO 2 emissions, while
concrete carbonation may be useful if it improves concrete
strength and reduces overall concrete use.
Injection of large quantities of CO 2 into underground
reservoirs where it can be securely and permanently stored can
be successfully achieved with economic incentives to accelerate
field-scale applications of CO 2 sequestration. Significant
advances in site characterization, monitoring, and leak
assessment and management have occurred in the past 10
years. Legal and regulatory protocols have also been put into
place in the US. Over time, the leakage risk decreases while the
permanence of the storage increases, but the effectiveness of a
