**Abstract:** The problem of global warming and climate change has attracted global attention, and
reducing the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere is an important step towards solving the prob-
lem. This paper mainly introduces the current development status, research hotspots, challenges and
some emerging technologies of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Among CO 2 capture
technologies, solvent absorption technology is currently the most mature and widely used technology,
among which ionic liquid technology has great application prospects because its molecular structure
can be designed and different functional groups can be connected. The surface functionalization of
metal–organic frameworks in the adsorption method endows them with excellent CO 2 adsorption
capacity. In CO 2 transportation, temperature and pressure must be considered in pipeline transporta-
tion, because they will affect the phase state of CO 2 transportation. The impact of impurities on CO 2
pipeline transportation is a challenge that affects pipeline design and transportation safety. In CO 2
utilization, the key to enhanced oil recovery, gas recovery and displacement of coalbed methane is to
increase the recovery rate and increase the storage capacity at the same time. Only by strengthening
the research on the adsorption behavior between CO 2 and CH 4 and revealing the relevant mechanism
can innovative technologies be developed. The chemical utilization of CO 2 has formed many routes,
but they all lack certain advantages. Most scholars are working on catalysts for CO 2 conversion,
especially copper-based catalysts that can convert CO 2 into methanol. The conversion rate of CO 2
can be effectively increased through doping or process improvement. The coupling of electrocatalytic
technology and renewable energy is an important development direction in the future. In CO 2
storage, geological storage is currently the most important method, especially in saline aquifers.
There are currently critical issues concerning reservoir integrity and leakage potential that should
be further investigated. CO 2 leakage will cause serious environmental problems, and the common
monitoring methods are reviewed and discussed in this paper. Finally, the research status, hotspots
and cooperation networks of CCUS are summarized by using CiteSpace software in order to help
the development of CCUS technology. In addition, through the review and analysis, it is found
that CCUS is faced with challenges such as low capture efﬁciency, difﬁculties in transformation and
utilization, high operating costs, lack of strong support policies, and lack of international cooperation,
which restrict the further development of CCUS.

In the past few decades, due to human activities such as fossil fuel power generation,
more and more CO 2 in the atmosphere has been caused, and the greenhouse effect has
become more and more obvious. This poses a huge threat to human and global security. At
present, the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere has exceeded 400 ppm, which is about
40% higher than before industrialization, and the surface temperature has increased by
about 0.8 __ _◦_ C [ 1 ]. However, it is almost impossible to replace conventional power plants
with clean energy power generation in the short term. Moreover, the International Energy

The development level of CO 2 capture technology is the key to the whole CCUS
technology. It mainly uses methods such as solvent absorption, solid adsorption, membrane
separation and low-temperature separation to separate CO 2 in the mixed gas from other
components. CO 2 transport plays a connecting role in CCUS technology, which connects
carbon capture with storage and utilization. It can ensure the safe and economical operation
of the CCUS system. Pipeline transportation is the most common mode of transportation.
The cost of transporting one ton of CO 2 is 1–10 USD/km. The demand for CO 2 pipeline
construction will increase signiﬁcantly in the future. The utilization of CO 2 has attracted
extensive attention. It is currently mainly used for enhanced oil and gas recovery, but
people are paying more attention to other utilization methods of CO 2 , including chemical
industry raw materials, mineralization, biological utilization and the food industry. People
have developed a variety of conversion routes and methods to convert CO 2 into chemicals,
but most of them are in the pilot stage, mainly because of the high conversion cost and
low conversion efﬁciency. The amount of CO 2 used every year is very small, which is far
lower than the emission of CO 2 . Moreover, the used CO 2 will be re-released at the end of
the product life cycle. But its importance lies in the indirect reduction of CO 2 emissions by
avoiding the use of fossil carbon. In the future, if we want to achieve the goal of carbon
neutrality, CO 2 storage will still be the main strategy. CO 2 storage can be divided into
geological storage and ocean storage. Geological storage is the most common form of
storage, especially in saline aquifers. It sequesters CO 2 from the atmosphere, and over time
the CO 2 is converted into carbonate minerals for permanent storage.
CCUS technology has achieved remarkable development in recent years. It can
ensure large-scale low-carbon utilization of fossil energy. It is a necessary solution for
the decarbonization of industries that are having difﬁculty reducing emissions. There
are more than 30 CCUS programs in operation around the world. Among them, North
America is dominated by CO 2 ﬂooding. In Europe, ocean storage of CO 2 is the main
focus. Most of these commercially operated projects use chemical absorption technology
or physical absorption technology to capture CO 2 and use pipeline transportation or
ship transportation technology to transport it. At present, relevant research on CCUS is
constantly increasing, but most of them are focused on one side, as shown in Table 1 , and
few articles can systematically and comprehensively review various techniques in CCUS. A
detailed review of various technologies in CCUS will help people better understand CCUS
technology and help in its development. In addition, CCUS also faces many challenges in
each link, which restricts the implementation of CCUS projects. By analyzing the existing
problems and challenges of CCUS technology, this paper points out the future development
direction of CCUS technology.

In this review, we followed the following steps: First, we used keywords such as CCUS,
CO 2 capture, CO 2 transportation, CO 2 utilization and CO 2 storage to search the Web of
Science core database. The search content does not include books and core papers, and the
period covered is 2006–2021. Then, by simply reading the abstract, we screened the relevant
literature. In this step, we screened 558 pieces of literature. Finally, we further screened
the downloaded literature by careful reading and reduced the number to 265 articles . The
screening criteria were to see whether they are closely related to the theme of this review.
Finally, this paper will examine CCUS technology in detail through four parts: CO 2 capture,
CO 2 transport, CO 2 utilization and CO 2 storage based on the 265 articles. This paper
mainly introduces the current development status, research hotspots, challenges and some
emerging technologies of CCUS technology. At the same time, CiteSpace software is
used to measure and analyze these documents and analyze the research status, trends
and cooperation.

**2. CO** **2** **Capture**

According to the combustion process of fossil fuels and the technical basis of the CO 2
capture system, carbon capture can be simply divided into three processes: post-combustion
capture, pre-combustion capture and oxyfuel combustion capture. Post-combustion capture
mainly refers to the capture of CO 2 from the waste gas produced by the combustion of fossil
fuels or other carbon-containing fuels. It is currently the most widely used carbon capture
strategy. Its technology is currently highly mature and has a large number of commercial
applications [ 12 ]. Compared with pre-combustion capture and oxyfuel combustion capture,
it has several advantages, for example, the transformation of CO 2 emission sources is
small, it can be quickly applied to existing power plants, and the later maintenance cost
is small. It also has a small impact on production activities and high ﬂexibility [ 13 ]. Of
course, the carbon capture efﬁciency is low due to the low content of CO 2 in the gas after
combustion [ 14 ]. At the same time, the separation effect will also be affected because the
gas after combustion contains other impurities. In conclusion, post- combustion capture
technology needs to develop efﬁcient and ideal adsorption materials, and improve the
energy efﬁciency of post-combustion carbon capture equipment. At present, most research
focuses on post-combustion capture strategy [ 15 ]. Common capture technologies are shown
in Figure 2 , which will be described in detail below.

_2.1. Solvent Absorption Technology_

Solvent absorption technology is the most widely used CO 2 capture technology at
present, which is mainly used for post-combustion capture and pre-combustion capture.
Due to its good separation effect, low application cost and relatively mature technology, it
is the key technology to implement the “Zero Emissions Energy Strategy”. In this article,
we will divide solvent absorption into the physical absorption method, chemical absorption
method and the physical–chemical absorption method according to whether physical and
chemical reactions occur in the process of solvent absorption. In addition, since the current
research focus has been extended to the use of solvent mixtures, we will also discuss them
in this article.

In chemical absorption technology, commonly used solvents mainly include ammonia,
potassium carbonate, amino solvent and alkaline solvent [ 17 ]. Among them, amino solvents
are considered to be the most developed among the currently studied solvents and are
widely used in post-combustion carbon capture (PCC). Its disadvantage is that the amine is
easily degraded during long-term operation, and its capture property is reduced [ 18 ]. It has
the advantages of high chemical reactivity with CO 2 , low production cost and large-scale
stable operation [ 19 ]. Ammonia aqueous solution is superior to conventional ammonia

cause corrosion to equipment, etc. In practical application, the negative effects of SO x ,
NO x and oxygen on absorbents should also be considered in developing more appropriate
models [ 20 ]. In order to overcome these shortcomings, many scholars began to study some
additives and mixtures (such as piperazine (PZ) and PZ derivatives). Reducing the energy
consumption of chemical absorption technology is an important research direction for the
future. Energy consumption can be effectively reduced by process improvement (heat
integration strategy) or by using solvents with high heat absorption.

2.1.2. Physical Absorption Technology

Physical absorption technology can be applied when CO 2 and liquid solvents do
not undergo obvious chemical reactions, and its operation is based on Henry’s Law [ 20 ].
Physical absorption is suitable for use under high pressure and low temperature so that
the solubility of the gas in a liquid solvent will be greater [ 16 ]. The physical absorption
method has a simple process, high operating pressure, and can capture some other harmful
gases, but the recovery rate of CO 2 is low, which is usually applied to situations where the
requirements for gas puriﬁcation are not high.
Physical absorption methods usually include the propylene carbonate method, the
polyglycol dimethyl ether method and the low-temperature methanol washing method.
Different physical absorption methods have different advantages and disadvantages, see
Table 2 for their comparison. Physical solvent has good application in integrated gasiﬁcation
combined cycle (IGCC) power generation facilities, with high capture efﬁciency and low
energy loss [ 16 , 21 ].

Chemical absorption technology and physical absorption technology have different
advantages and disadvantages. Chemical absorption technology is suitable for absorbing
CO 2 at low pressure, and physical absorption technology applies to absorbing CO 2 at high
pressure. In chemical absorption technology, due to the chemical reaction between CO 2
and solvent molecules in forming chemical bonds, it is highly selective to CO 2 . In physical
absorption, although there is a weak interaction between CO 2 and solvent, its regeneration
energy is low [ 22 ]. Therefore, is there a method that can combine the advantages of these
two methods? For this reason, people began to study solvent-mixing technology.

2.1.3. Solvent Mixed Absorption Technology

Single solvent systems have been deeply studied, and many properties of solvents
have been deﬁned. At present, the research focus has been on the research and development
of solvent mixtures, which can be developed by mixing various solvents and synergistic
effects with accelerants. At present, promising solvent mixtures include amine-based
blends, NH 3 -based blends, K 2 CO 3 -based blends and deep eutectic solvents. These blends
mainly combine the advantages of different solvents. For example, ethanolamine sulfolane
water is an amino blend, which combines physical and chemical solvents, and has the
advantages of both methods. Alcohol amine is a chemical solvent, which can absorb organic
sulfur in the mixed gas and can also dissolve part of H 2 S and CO 2 . Sulfolane is a physical
solvent, which can absorb CO 2 in the mixture. This solvent has a wide application range,

_Energies_ **2023** , _16_ , 2865 7 of 48

low CO 2 content in puriﬁed gas and low corrosivity [ 22 ]. The mixture of MEA + MDEA
is a typical synergistic effect. The reaction rate is increased by adding MEA, and the
regeneration energy is reduced by adding MDEA.
Deep eutectic solvent is a new green solvent developed to overcome the high price
and toxicity of traditional ionic solvents. Usually, two components are mixed according
to a certain molar ratio, and the melting point of the eutectic solvent formed is usually
lower than that of each component. Deep eutectic solvents have many advantages, such
as low price, easy degradation, and little environmental pollution, and are suitable for
large-scale preparation [ 18 , 23 ]. The most common deep eutectic solvent is a combination of
quaternary ammonium halide and hydrogen bond donor [ 24 , 25 ]. At present, the research
and development of deep eutectic solvents are still in the initial state. Although much
progress has been made, there is still some distance to go before large-scale commercial use.

2.1.4. Ionic Liquid Absorption Technology

An ionic liquid is a kind of “green solvent”, which has the advantages of wide oper-
ating pressure, low corrosion, and easy separation of products. The designability of its
molecular structure creates opportunities for the design of ionic liquids. By connecting
different functional groups, ionic liquids for different purposes can be obtained [ 26 ]. The
common functional groups include amine, ﬂuorine atom, hydroxyl, etc. The introduction
of cation in an amino group is more effective, and ionic liquids with multiple amine sites
usually have higher CO 2 absorption capacity than ionic liquids with one primary amine
group. Ionic liquids containing hydroxyl groups have good separation performance of CO 2
at low pressure [ 27 ]. Xu [ 28 ] proved that the addition of super bases during the preparation
of ionic liquids can effectively improve their ability to capture CO 2 .
Of course, in addition to the inﬂuence of functional groups, the length of the alkyl
chain and the type of anion will affect the CO 2 absorption capacity and viscosity of the
ionic liquid [ 26 , 29 ]. Ionic liquids usually have high viscosity, especially those containing
amino groups. This is usually due to the formation of hydrogen bonds in ionic liquids.
The viscosity of ionic liquids can be reduced by introducing hydrogen receptors, or by
mixing with organic solvents [ 27 , 30 ]. H 2 S and CH 4 need to be separated before CO 2 capture
because they will reduce the solubility of CO 2 and the selectivity of ionic liquids [ 31 ].
Although ionic liquids have great application prospects in CO 2 capture, most of the
current applications of ionic liquids are limited to laboratories. Ionic liquids are expensive
and the production process is complex, which are the main factor hindering the large-scale
application of ionic liquids [ 32 ]. In addition, the potential toxicity and non-degradability
of ionic liquids also hinder the large-scale application of ionic liquids. Thermodynamic
models of CO 2 and ionic liquid systems also present challenges that require further study
in the future.

_2.2. Solid Adsorption Technology_

The solid adsorption technology is mainly realized by the intermolecular attraction
between the gas or liquid and the active point on the solid adsorbent. The adsorption of
CO 2 by an adsorbent is usually realized by physical adsorption or chemical adsorption [ 33 ].
Good adsorbent, regeneration process and adsorption cycle time are required in the adsorp-
tion process [ 34 ]. This paper will mainly discuss the research progress of solid adsorbents
by reviewing: carbon-based adsorbents, porous materials and other adsorbents.

2.2.1. Carbon-Based Adsorbent

Carbon-based sorbents mainly refer to materials composed of carbon atoms, which
are simple to prepare and low in cost. They are usually used to capture CO 2 under high
pressure because the adsorption capacity of CO 2 usually increases with the increase of
pressure. The amount, size and distribution of voids in carbon-based adsorbents play
an important role in CO 2 capture. By adding various functional groups on the surface
of the carbon-based adsorbent, its carbon capture performance can be optimized [ 35 ]. In



-----


_Energies_ **2023** , _16_ , 2865 8 of 48

the carbon matrix, increasing the pH of some parts of the surface will change the charge
distribution on the surface and enhance its adsorption capacity [ 36 ]. The interaction
between carbon-based adsorbents and CO 2 is very weak, so this presents a challenge for
the selectivity and capacity of carbon-based adsorbents, especially at high temperatures
and low partial pressures. Common carbon-based adsorbents include biochar, activated
carbon and graphene-based adsorbents.
Biochar has a high speciﬁc surface area, micropore, porosity and various functional
groups. Its structure and surface properties determine that it is an excellent CO 2 adsorbent.
Biochar is an environmentally friendly and economical material [ 34 , 37 – 40 ]. Activated
carbon is a kind of widely used carbon-based adsorbent. Its adsorption capacity is lower
than that of zeolite or molecular sieve, and it will decrease signiﬁcantly with the increase in
temperature [ 33 , 41 ]. Activated carbon raw materials have a wide range of sources, with a
wide range of pore size distribution and pore structure, and its manufacturing cost also
has huge advantages [ 42 ]. Activated carbon produced by biomass containing heteroatoms
(Such as O, S, P and N) can better absorb CO 2 [ 43 ]. Activated carbon can be divided into
physical activated carbon and chemical activated carbon according to the activation mode.
Different reaction conditions and activated chemicals will affect the physical and chemical
properties of activated carbon, such as speciﬁc surface area, surface functional groups,
shape, etc. [ 44 – 49 ]. Future research work on activated carbon will focus on improving its
adsorption capacity and selectivity at low CO 2 partial pressure and producing adsorbents
with adjustable active surface area and pore size. Graphene-based adsorbent is a carbon
nano material, because its two-dimensional and hexagonal-ﬁlled lattice structure is similar
to a honeycomb single carbon layer, and the active functional groups on the surface make
it have good physical and chemical properties [ 50 – 53 ]. Graphene has a poor CO 2 adsorp-
tion effect, and its adsorption performance can be enhanced through activation, because
activation can make graphene produce a three-dimensional structure, giving it a large
surface area [ 54 ]. At present, the most effective graphene-based adsorbent is PANI/HEG
(polyaniline/hydrogen exfoliated graphene), which has good cycle performance [ 55 ]. Fu-
ture research on graphene is mainly aimed at improving its CO 2 adsorption capacity by
attaching different functional groups and heteroatoms to its surface.

2.2.2. Porous Material

At present, many porous materials are widely studied for carbon capture. Porous
materials have the advantages of high absorption efﬁciency and large adsorption capacity.
The pore diameter, geometric shape and speciﬁc surface area of porous materials will
affect the CO 2 capture effect. The commonly used porous materials include zeolites, metal–
organic frameworks (MOFs) and mesoporous materials.
MOFs are emerging crystalline porous materials, which have the advantages of high
pore volume, structural diversity, easily adjustable pore structure and surface functional-
ization [ 56 , 57 ]. MOFs are widely used in gas storage, drug delivery and heterogeneous
catalysis, but their application in the selective adsorption of gas is one of the most active
research ﬁelds at present [ 41 ]. MOFs can be functionalized by different methods to improve
their CO 2 adsorption capacity. Common methods include adding polar functional groups,
opening metal sites and modifying with Lewis basic sites [ 41 , 56 , 58 ]. These methods can
better exploit the tailorability of MOFs, making them possess excellent CO 2 adsorption
capacity. However, the cost of production and utilization of MOFs is too high at present, so
it is difﬁcult to use them on a large scale. In addition, the synthesis process of MOFs will
cause environmental pollution, which also limits its application. In the future, reducing
its synthesis cost and environmental pollution during the synthesis process are the main
research directions.
Zeolite is a porous crystalline material composed of aluminosilicates, and most zeolites
for CO 2 capture are synthetic. Synthetic zeolite can control its porosity and crystallinity in
the process of synthesis, so it has more advantages than natural zeolite in capturing CO 2 .

zeolite for CO 2 adsorption can be customized [ 59 ]. When most zeolites encounter water
molecules, their CO 2 capture performance will decline. However, the hydrophobicity of
zeolites with a higher silicon–aluminum ratio will be enhanced, and the hydrophobicity can
also be increased by introducing hydrophobic functional groups [ 60 ]. Although synthetic
zeolite has good trapping performance, its application is restricted by its high synthetic
cost and environmental pollution.
During the past decade, mesoporous materials have become favorable candidates for
CO 2 capture materials. Common mesoporous materials include mesoporous silica and
mesoporous metal oxides. Silica is one of the most abundant substances in the world. Meso-
porous silica is usually prepared by the Stöber method, and its pore diameter and speciﬁc
surface area can be easily adjusted [ 59 ]. Mesoporous silica is a CO 2 adsorbent suitable for
amine loading. The rich hydroxyl groups on the surface of silica are conducive to amine
functionalization and improve its CO 2 adsorption capacity [ 61 ]. Common mesoporous
metal oxides include TiO 2 , MgO, alumina and cerium oxide [ 62 – 64 ] in which mesoporous
ceria has the largest CO 2 adsorption capacity. TiO 2 can also quickly absorb CO 2 .

by permeating one or more gases from one side of the membrane to the other side through

be separated on both sides of the membrane. The gas absorption membrane (Figure 4 b)
is mainly used to selectively absorb gas through a chemical absorption solution, and the
membrane only serves to isolate gas and absorption solution.

### Gas separation membranes can be divided into three categori

Gas separation membranes can be divided into three categories: inorganic membranes,
organic polymer membranes and mixed matrix membranes. The relationship between the
selectivity and permeability of most polymer membranes is shown in Figure 5 . The perme-
ability of polymer membranes with high selectivity is generally poor. In order to solve this
problem, people began to study mixed matrix membranes. Norahim et al. [ 66 ] discussed
the inﬂuence of different ﬁllers on composite membranes. For example, mixing carbon
nanoﬁbers with polysulfone can improve its selectivity and permeability. The dendriform
mixed matrix membrane is composed of polyether block amide (PEBA), polyethylene
glycol (PEG) and nano-X zeolite, its CO 2 permeability and selectivity increase with the
increase of feed pressure and PEG loading [ 67 ]. Some studies have shown that the addition

The gas absorption membrane mainly relies on the selectivity of the absorption liquid
to achieve the purpose of separating and absorbing CO 2 . Under ideal conditions, the
gas absorption membrane operates in a non-wetting mode, so there should be only a gas
phase in the membrane pore. In order to ensure that the liquid phase will not penetrate
the membrane pores, microporous membranes made of highly hydrophobic polymers are
usually used [ 65 , 69 – 71 ]. Improving the hydrophobicity of the membrane is the key to
solving the problem of membrane wetting. The direct use of highly hydrophobic materials
will increase the cost. Usually, a thin layer of such materials is coated on the cheaper
membrane to reduce the cost. Another method is to improve the hydrophobicity of the
membrane by changing the surface roughness and surface tension energy [ 72 ]. In addition
to studying membrane materials, an in-depth understanding of wetting mechanisms related
to membrane performance and operating conditions should also be gained.
Membrane separation technology can also be divided into promoted membranes
and non-promoted membranes. The action mechanism of a non-promoted membrane
mainly depends on the “solution diffusion” transport process. In addition to the “solution
diffusion characteristics”, the transport promotion membrane also includes an active
transport mechanism to improve the permeability and selectivity of membrane materials.
Supported liquid membranes (SLMs) are the ﬁrst kind of transport-promoting membranes
developed. They are non-dispersive liquid membranes, which mainly ﬁll the pores of
porous materials with liquid through capillary force as a selective material. It is generally
divided into two types: mobile carrier and ﬁxed carrier [ 73 ]. When ionic liquids are used
to ﬁll the pores, ionic liquids are mobile carriers, usually called SILMs. The interaction
between ionic liquids and carriers will affect the distribution and separation performance
of ionic liquids on carrier pores. For example, SILMs with hydrophobic carriers are more
stable than SILMs with hydrophilic carriers [ 74 , 75 ]. Ahmad et al [ 70 ]. found that the higher
the content of the ionic liquid in the membrane, the lower its selectivity. When using
nano porous or porous oxide as the base membrane, the selectivity and permeability of
ionic liquids can be enhanced [ 76 ]. The ﬁxed-position carrier membrane uses the inherent

chemical reaction with the ﬁxed position to “jump” CO 2 from one ﬁxed carrier to the next
through the membrane during CO 2 capture. The research and development of promoted
membranes are helping to improve permeability and selectivity [ 77 ].

_2.4. Other Technologies_
2.4.1. Low-Temperature Separation Technology

Low-temperature separation technology is a green method, which uses the differ-
ence of relative volatility of each component in raw materials to separate each component
by distillation [ 78 ]. Sreenivasulu et al. [ 79 ] compared several low-temperature separa-
tion methods and found that condensation rotary separation is the only feasible option,
with less energy loss and higher CO 2 separation yield. Belaissaoui et al. [ 80 ] studied the
mixed membrane low-temperature process for CO 2 capture after combustion. The results
showed that when the imported CO 2 concentration was 30%, compared with the single
low-temperature method, the mixed process could effectively improve energy efﬁciency.
Xu et al. [ 81 ] studied a cryogenic capture system to capture CO 2 in the ﬂue gas of an
LNG power generation system. This system can make full use of the cold energy of LNG
during gasiﬁcation. The results show that if the ﬂue gas temperature can be reduced to
below _−_ 140 __ _◦_ C, the CO 2 recovery rate can reach 90%. Song et al. [ 82 ] summarized the
existing low-temperature CO 2 capture technology and concluded that low-temperature
separation technology is more competitive only when low-cost cold energy is available.
Low-temperature separation technology is only suitable for high-concentration CO 2 ﬂow
(above 90%), not for dilute CO 2 ﬂow. In the future, we should optimize the operation
parameters and process of the low-temperature capture system and make full use of the
cold energy of the remaining gas after capture [ 10 ].

2.4.2. Microalgae

Among photosynthetic organisms, microalgae capture CO 2 through its photosyn-
thesis, which is a potential and promising candidate organism for carbon capture. The
photosynthetic rate of microalgae is higher than that of terrestrial plants. Its cell structure is
simple, its growth rate is fast, and its environmental adaptability is strong. Therefore, CO 2
biological ﬁxation through microalgae is more effective than that of terrestrial plants. Mean-
while, algae have a carbon-enrichment mechanism that inhibits photorespiration [ 82 , 83 ].
Song et al. [ 84 ] summarized the existing absorption-microalgae composite CO 2 capture
technology and concluded that the absorption microalgae composite CO 2 capture technol-
ogy can overcome the shortcomings of traditional absorption and microalgae ﬁxation, that
is, the absorption technology has high energy consumption for regeneration and low CO 2
solubility in microalgae solution. It is very promising to use microalgae to directly capture
CO 2 in the ﬂue gas generated by fossil fuel power plants or steel plants. Thomas et al. [ 85 ]
discussed four strategies for biological mitigation of CO 2 in ﬂue gas, and they concluded
that it is the most economical to supply ﬂue gas directly to the microalgae photobioreactor,
but it is necessary to select appropriate microalgae species to withstand the composition
and high temperature of ﬂue gas. It is also found that directly injecting ﬂue gas into the
pond containing microalgae can increase biomass productivity by 30%, which may be
due to the presence of supplementary nutrients in the ﬂue gas, resulting in the fertilizer
effect [ 86 ]. Of course, CO 2 capture by microalgae also has disadvantages. It requires speciﬁc
geological and geomorphic structures, expensive separation equipment, uncertainty and
long-term leakage risk. Therefore, in order to apply the microalgae capture technology on
a large scale, it will be necessary to develop carbon source treatment technologies with
different chemical forms and distribution characteristics, improve the utilization rate of
industrial waste gas and optimize the cultivation process [ 87 ].

2.4.3. Chemical Looping Combustion Technology

The basic principle of chemical looping combustion technology (CLC) is to decompose
the traditional combustion of direct contact reaction between fuel and air into two gas-solid

reactions with the help of an oxygen carrier. The fuel and air do not need to contact, and
the oxygen in the air is transferred to the fuel by the oxygen carrier. The oxygen carrier
is periodically oxidized and reduced with air and fuel. CLC technology is considered the
most cost-effective CO 2 capture technology with the least energy loss. Its ﬂow chart is
shown in Figure 6 . Oxygen carriers are usually transition metal oxides, because they are
easy to reduce and reoxidize, and are suitable for recycling between two reactors [ 88 , 89 ] .
Sajen et al. [ 90 ] studied the mixture of transition metal oxides (Such as CuO) and man-
ganese oxides in CLC and found that the mixed oxides showed good activity for the
oxidation of syngas fuel. Adanez et al. [ 91 ] compared the carbon capture efﬁciency of in
situ gasiﬁcation chemical chain combustion process (iG–CLC) and oxygen uncoupling
chemical chain process (CLOU) under different reactor temperatures and different coals.
The results show that the carbon capture efﬁciency and combustion efﬁciency of CLOU
are better than those of iG–CLC. Hu et al. [ 92 ] compared various commonly used oxygen
carriers and concluded that calcium oxide is an ideal CO 2 carrier material with low cost,
non-toxic and renewable. Among many chemical chain combustion reactors, a ﬂuidized
bed reactor is considered to be the best choice for large-scale application of chemical chain
combustion technology. The ﬂuidized bed reactor provides high solid circulation, which
makes the fuel fully contact with the oxygen carrier in the fuel reactor, providing sufﬁcient
oxidation and reduction time for the oxygen carrier [ 93 ].

at atmospheric concentration levels, low pressure and low temperature, with low energy

(such as the need to scale up fuel cell modules, and the high cost and safety of fuel cells),
high-temperature fuel cells are still an excellent strategy for CO 2 emission reduction in
power plants.
Zhang et al. [ 97 ] gave an overview of a new high-temperature electrochemical CO 2
transfer membrane. They compared several membranes made of different materials and
evaluated some CO 2 capture reactors based on these membranes. At the same time, the
concept of electrochemical CO 2 capture and conversion ﬁlm was successfully demonstrated
on a laboratory scale. Bae et al. [ 98 ] modiﬁed a seawater battery system for desalination
and carbon capture. As shown in Figure 7 , the system is mainly composed of three
compartments: desalination, sodium collection, and carbon capture. The compartments
are separated by sodium ion superconducting ceramic membranes. By charging and
discharging the system, sodium ions are transferred from the desalination compartment
to the carbon capture compartment, and hydroxide (OH _−_ ) ions are formed in the carbon
capture compartment at the same time, and the hydroxide (OH _−_ ) ions and Na + , Ca 2+ ,
Mg 2+  React with CO 2 introduced in the atmosphere to form metal carbonate, to achieve the
purpose of capturing CO 2 . The biggest shortcoming of this system at present is that the
reaction of chlorine analysis is relatively difﬁcult, and silver foil is temporarily used as a
collecting electrode.

###### After the CO 2 is separated from the ﬂue gas, it must be transported to a storage sit

After the CO 2 is separated from the ﬂue gas, it must be transported to a storage site
for storage or a factory for processing and utilization. Regardless of the ultimate fate of
CO 2 , a safe, reliable and economically viable CO 2 transportation system is a key link in the
realization of CCUS technology. At present, the main transportation methods of CO 2 are
tanker transportation, pipeline transportation and ship transportation. Different shipping
methods are suitable for different shipping situations. Example: A power plant with a
design life of more than 23 years that produces CO 2 suitable for pipeline transportation.
For some short cycles CO 2 transportation, tanker transportation and ship transportation
are more competitive [ 1 ]. The amount of CO 2 and the distance between the way of CO 2
capture and the storage location are critical to the choice of CO 2 transport mode. In this
section of the review, we will focus on pipeline transportation and ship transportation.

_3.1. Pipeline Transportation Technology_

Pipeline transportation is the most economical way to transport large quantities of CO 2 .
At present, the length of global CO 2 pipelines exceeds 8000 km, and most of these pipelines
are located in the United States. However, this length is far from meeting the demand
for CO 2 pipeline transportation under the carbon-neutral target, and a large number of
CO 2 pipelines need to be built in the future. This section summarizes the research on
CO 2 pipeline transportation from three aspects: transportation status and process, pipeline
design and ﬂow assurance, and transportation safety and risk [ 99 , 100 ].

3.1.1. Conveying Status and Process

_Energies_ **2023** , _16_ , x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 o


CO 2 has low critical temperature and pressure and is prone to phase changes. Its
transport forms include gas transport, liquid transport, dense phase transport and super-
critical transport. When multi-phase ﬂows in the pipeline, CO 2 is easy to change phase and
causes pipe cavitation, so CO 2 is usually transported in single-phase. Similar to oil and
gas pipelines, CO 2 also needs to be supplied with pressure through a compressor or pump
to meet the purpose of transmission. Through practice, it is found that gas transportation
and liquid transportation are more suitable for short-distance pipelines, and dense phase
transportation and supercritical transportation are more suitable for long-distance pipelines.
Among them, supercritical transportation and dense phase transportation are more eco-
nomical [ 101 ]. Figure 8 shows the process ﬂow diagram of these four conveying modes.

###### Some scholars and institutions have conducted some research on CO 2 pipeline tr

Some scholars and institutions have conducted some research on CO 2 pipeline trans-
portation [ 102 ]. Zhang et al. [ 103 ] found that the low critical temperature (31.1 __ _◦_ C) of CO 2 is
an important feature, and the control system temperature and pressure directly determine
the process design and pressure loss of the system. Under favorable climatic conditions,
CO 2 transport in the supercooled liquid state can signiﬁcantly save energy. At the same
time, they also found that CO 2 has the largest safe transport distance. Lu et al. [ 104 ] de-
termined the ﬂow transmission range of different pipe diameters according to the phase
change during the transportation of liquid CO 2 . Drescher et al. veriﬁed the ability of
the Schlumberger ﬂow assurance tool OLGA and SINTEF Energy Research’s in-house
CFD tool to simulate the decompression behavior of a CO 2 pipeline. Their simulation
results are consistent with the experiment. However, OLGA and SINTEF deviate from the
experimental results in terms of simulated temperature [ 105 ].

small. The pipe diameter determines the transmission capacity. Too small a diameter will
cause too high a CO 2 ﬂow rate, increasing pressure loss and corrosion of the pipe wall [ 106 ].
Therefore, the most reasonable pipe diameter is the minimum pipe diameter to meet the
CO 2 transmission requirements [ 107 ]. Mohammadi et al. [ 108 ] proposed a cost optimization
framework for a CO 2 transportation system and concluded that pipe diameter and horizon-
tal angle are important parameters for pipe design. When designing the CO 2 pipeline, the
wall thickness of the pipeline should also be considered. Different transportation modes
will also affect the wall thickness design of the pipeline. Teh et al. [ 109 ] found that under
the same conditions in other cases, the wall thickness required for CO 2 liquid transportation
is less than that required for CO 2 supercritical transportation. When the captured CO 2 is
stored, differences in potential reservoir capacity and injection capacity may signiﬁcantly
change the economy and design of the CO 2 transport system. Wang et al. [ 110 ] proposed a
decision tree-based method by analyzing some cases, which can quickly and accurately
estimate the best reservoir selection and pipeline design without any optimization.
Temperature and pressure are the key factors to control CO 2 pipeline transportation.
Changes in temperature and pressure will change the phase state of CO 2 and affect the
normal operation of the pipeline [ 111 ]. In recent years, many scholars began to study
it. Lu et al. [ 101 ] found that under the same operating conditions, the pressure drop of
a CO 2 pipeline is lower than that of natural gas pipeline, but its temperature drop is
larger, so hydrates are more likely to be generated in a CO 2 pipeline. The existence of
impurities will affect the thermophysical properties of CO 2 , thus affecting the pipeline
transportation of CO 2 [ 112 ]. Lee et al. [ 113 ] studied the in-tube heat transfer coefﬁcient
and compressor power consumption with impurity CO 2 . It was found that both the heat
transfer coefﬁcient and the compressor power consumption followed the trend of pure
CO 2 , but were inﬂuenced by the type and amount of impurities. Baik et al. [ 114 ] studied
the pressure drop of CO 2 + CH 4 in the pipe under seawater conditions. With the decrease
of CO 2 mole fraction, the average pressure drop in the pipe increases, and the pressure
drop of CO 2 + CH 4 increases with the increase of mass ﬂow rate. Teh et al. [ 109 ] studied
the difference between the transportation of liquid CO 2 and supercritical CO 2 at ambient
temperature. The authors believe that as long as the liquid CO 2 pipeline is buried deep
enough in the soil with poor thermal conductivity, it does not need to keep the trunk line
warm, and the same amount of CO 2 is transported at the same distance. Liquid CO 2 is
superior to supercritical CO 2 .

3.1.3. Transportation Safety and Risk

At present, most of the existing CO 2 pipelines are located in less densely populated
areas, but in the near future, CO 2 pipelines may span densely populated areas. As CO 2 is
toxic at a certain concentration, the harm of CO 2 at different concentrations to the human
body is shown in Figure 9 [ 115 ]. At present, the safety and risk research of CO 2 pipelines
mainly includes three aspects: the impact of impurities on CO 2 pipeline transportation, the
corrosion of CO 2 pipeline and the accidental leakage of CO 2 pipeline [ 116 ].
In the process of carbon capture, due to the different sources and capture methods of
CO 2 , there are often different types of impurities in the pipeline CO 2 ﬂuid. The allowable
limit of impurities in CO 2 depends on the geological conditions of the storage formation
or the use speciﬁcations [ 117 , 118 ]. The content of impurities is usually very low, but the
existence of a small number of impurities will also have an adverse effect on the safe
operation of the pipeline [ 119 , 120 ]. Zhao et al. [ 120 ] believed that the equation of state
is very important for calculating the heat transfer and pressure drop of a CO 2 pipeline.
The PR equation of state applies to pure CO 2 . For CO 2 mixtures containing impurities,
the mixture parameters of the PR equation of state must be determined ﬁrst. The authors
also found that the effect of CH 4 , H 2 , NO 2 and other impurities on phase equilibrium
is different. Peletiri et al. [ 118 ] studied the inﬂuence of impurities on the ﬂow of CO 2 in
the pipeline. The authors found that nitrogen had the greatest inﬂuence on the pressure,
temperature and other physical parameters of CO 2 in the pipeline, while H 2 S had the least

pipeline [ 122 ]. Cui et al. [ 123 ] found that water content is the key factor affecting corrosion,
and controlling the water content below the critical water content is the most economical
and effective method to reduce corrosion. At the same time, the authors also found that
among the impurities contained in CO 2 , NO 2 had the most serious corrosion effect on CO 2
pipelines. When multiple gas impurities exist at the same time, there will be a synergistic
effect, which will have a more serious impact on corrosion. Tang et al. [ 122 ] summarized
the metal corrosion problems under the combination of various impurities and studied
the corrosion mechanism of synergistic effect and the formation mechanism of corrosion
products. Sim et al. [ 124 ] found that the corrosion mass loss increased with the increase in
water concentration, especially when the water concentration was greater than 1000 ppmw.
Pipeline leakage is also a potential risk during pipeline transportation. CO 2 pipeline
leakage may cause damage to the surrounding environment, which mainly depends on
the total amount of CO 2 released and the concentration reached near the leakage [ 125 ].
Herzog et al. [ 126 ] simulated the leakage and release process of an onshore high-pressure
CO 2 pipeline with CFD. Under the speciﬁc conditions for which it is set, the extent of the
plume increases with increasing temperature. The height of the plume increases with time
and depends on the release pressure and the size of the leak. Within a certain range, the
size of the leak hole has a much greater effect on the plume height than the release pressure.
Joshi et al. [ 127 ] found that after the leakage of the CO 2 pipeline, all solid formations were in
the expansion zone, and there were no solid formations in the pipeline. This also avoids the
possibility of crack propagation caused by solid polymer in the pipeline. At the same time,
the authors also found that 55% of the excessive dense gas concentration was observed
near the obstacle compared with the concentration on the ﬂat terrain. Xie et al. [ 128 ] found
through experiments that supercritical CO 2 showed a highly under-expanded jet structure
during the leakage process, and with the increase of the leakage size, the typical structure

disappeared. In the process of leakage, the mass loss of supercritical CO 2 is greater than
that of gaseous CO 2 .

_3.2. Ship Transportation Technology_

The CO 2 ship transport technology mainly refers to the transport of captured CO 2
to the designated place through a CO 2 carrier. Currently, only four CO 2 carriers are
put into operation in the world, mainly for the food service industry. The research on
ship transportation technology mainly focuses on its economy. Jung et al. [ 129 ] found
that the cost of CO 2 transportation by pipeline system in Korean offshore CCS projects
is lower. However, with the development of CO 2 carriers, the cost may be lower than
that of pipeline transportation. When the distance of CO 2 ocean transportation exceeds
350 km, the cost of ship transportation is lower than that of pipeline transportation [ 130 ].
Roussanaly et al. [ 131 ] analyzed the transportation costs of CO 2 carriers with pressures of
7 Barg and 15 Barg respectively. The authors found that for all the transportation distance
and annual transportation volume combinations considered, 7 Barg transportation has
more price advantages.
In a word, CO 2 transport is an important link between carbon capture and storage.
Pipeline transport technology and ship transport technology apply to large-scale CO 2
transport. The comparison between these two technologies is shown in Table 3 . Although
the development of CO 2 transport technology is relatively mature, however, it is still
necessary to continue to improve and study the impact of impurities on CO 2 pipelines and
the analysis of CO 2 leakage consequences.

**4. CO** **2** **Utilization**

In recent years, the utilization of CO 2 has received more and more attention. The best
way to remove CO 2 is to use CO 2 to make valuable products. At present, the global annual
CO 2 emissions exceed 32 billion tons, but the CO 2 utilization is less than 200 million tons.
From this point of view, the utilization of CO 2 is unlikely to signiﬁcantly reduce the content
of CO 2 in the atmosphere, but people pay more attention to the economic or environmental
beneﬁts of the process. Therefore, the utilization of CO 2 is considered a stepping stone for
the large-scale implementation of CCUS technology [ 133 – 135 ].
CO 2 can be used in a variety of ways, including technical, biological or chemical.
CO 2 can be directly used in energy production to help improve oil recovery, directly
used as raw material for chemicals, and directly used as raw material for bioenergy pro-
duction. CO 2 can also be directly used in the food processing industry. These uses are
discussed below [ 136 , 137 ].

_4.1. Strengthen Energy Production Technology_

Energy such as fossil fuels is the material basis for the survival and development of
human society. The traditional fossil fuel recovery technology and recovery efﬁciency are
limited, and the work efﬁciency is not high. The use of CO 2 in the recovery of fossil fuels
can not only effectively improve the recovery rate, but also play a role in CO 2 storage. As
shown in Figure 10 , CO 2 can be used to exploit oil, natural gas and coal bed methane.

It is more and more important for the petroleum industry to enhance the oil recovery
(EOR) process. CO 2 -enhanced oil recovery technology refers to a technology that uses CO 2
as the oil-displacement medium to improve oil recovery. This technology has been applied
for decades. The United States is an early country in the world to study and apply CO 2
ﬂooding technology. Stewart et al. [ 139 ] found that in the North Sea oilﬁeld, CO 2 ﬂooding
can maximize the production of mature oilﬁelds, and CO 2 ﬂooding can be used to produce
low-carbon oil. More than 90% of reservoirs in the world are suitable for CO 2– EOR [ 135 ]. In
the process of CO 2– EOR, the most important is the mixed phase of CO 2 and crude oil [ 140 ].
CO 2 ﬂooding technology mainly includes miscible ﬂooding and immiscible ﬂooding. At
present, immiscible ﬂooding technology is rarely used, and the most ideal technology
is miscible ﬂooding. Miscible ﬂooding can achieve the highest oil recovery during CO 2
ﬂooding. The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) is very important for the miscible
ﬂooding of CO 2 . The lower miscibility pressure is beneﬁcial to the economic operation of
CO 2 ﬂooding projects.
CO 2 ﬂooding has become one of the most commonly used EOR methods. Many
scholars have begun to study the inﬂuencing factors of CO 2 ﬂooding and how to improve
the recovery factor of CO 2 ﬂooding. Cao et al. [ 141 ] found that in the process of CO 2
immiscible ﬂooding, the oil recovery rate increases with the increase of pressure. When the
pressure exceeds the minimum miscible pressure, the oil recovery rate slightly increases
and ﬁnally stabilizes near a maximum value. The wettability of the reservoir will also
affect the recovery factor of CO 2 ﬂooding, and the recovery factor of oil–wet cores is higher
than that of water–wet cores [ 142 ]. Hamidi et al. [ 143 ] studied the effect of ultrasonic-
assisted CO 2 ﬂooding on oil recovery. Under an appropriate injection rate, ultrasonic-
assisted CO 2 ﬂooding can improve oil recovery. In addition to research on enhanced oil
recovery, monitoring downhole and blowdown emissions from CO 2 displacement and
strengthening risk management need to be considered. At the same time, we should speed
up the construction of the CCUS–EOR technical standard system to promote the rapid and
proﬁtable development of the entire industry chain.

4.1.2. Strengthening Gas Production Technology

Enhanced gas production technology mainly refers to injecting CO 2 into a gas reservoir
or shale reservoir in supercritical form to enhance gas recovery (CO 2 –EGR), while storing
CO 2 . The key to improving natural gas recovery by CO 2 is to control the miscibility of CO 2

and CH 4 . CO 2 and natural gas are miscible at any ratio, which will reduce the displacement
of CO 2 on natural gas and reduce the recovery of natural gas. At the same time, CO 2 –EGR
does not apply to all gas ﬁelds [ 144 , 145 ]. Gas mixing can be limited by good reservoir
management and production control measures [ 146 ].
As unconventional natural gas, shale gas has attracted worldwide attention in recent
years. As a new shale gas development technology, CO 2 ﬂooding of shale gas is developing
rapidly [ 120 ]. About 20~80% of natural gas can be stored in shale gas reservoirs in the form
of adsorption. The properties, moisture, temperature, pressure and other conditions of
shale gas reservoirs will affect the adsorption behavior of CO 2 and CH 4 . In reservoirs with
more micropores, the preferential adsorption of CO 2 may be higher. When the pressure
increases, the preferential adsorption of CO 2 will become weaker [ 147 ]. However, the
increase in CO 2 injection pressure will increase the recovery of CH 4 and the storage of
CO 2 [ 148 ]. The CO 2 content in the injected gas also has a great inﬂuence on the desorption
of natural gas from rocks [ 149 ]. When supercritical CO 2 is injected into shale, the porosity
and speciﬁc surface area of shale will also increase with time and pressure. At the same
time, the pore structure and surface chemistry in shale will also change, resulting in a
decline in the adsorption capacity of shale for CO 2 and methane [ 150 , 151 ].
During CO 2 ﬂooding of shale gas, the recovery depends on the relative afﬁnity of
CO 2 and CH 4 in their mixture. Therefore, the adsorption study of the mixed gas is of
great signiﬁcance for CO 2 ﬂooding shale gas. Song et al. [ 152 ] found that the isothermal
adsorption capacity of CH 4 /CO 2 decreased with the increase in temperature, and the
adsorption capacity of CO 2 was greater than that of methane. Qi et al. [ 147 ] found that
the total adsorption capacity of the CH 4 /CO 2 mixture is between two single components.
The shape of the isothermal adsorption curve of the mixed gas is similar to that of a
single component with a high concentration or strong adsorption afﬁnity. When CO 2
is injected into shale, the interaction between adsorbed gas and the nanopore structure
may lead to shale expansion, fracture closure and reduction of permeability of the shale
formation [ 153 , 154 ]. Lu et al. [ 155 ] found that the increase in CO 2 pressure will make the
expansion of shale samples ﬁrst increase and then decrease. The maximum expansion of
shale will gradually decrease with the increase in CO 2 temperature. Strengthening the
research on CO 2 adsorption behavior is helpful to the development of CO 2 -enhanced gas
recovery technology [ 156 ].

4.1.3. Technology of Displacing Coalbed Methane

The technique of displacing coalbed methane is to use CO 2 as an adsorbent and inject it
into the coal seam to improve the recovery rate of coalbed methane by taking advantage of
the characteristic that its adsorption capacity on the surface of the coal body is higher than
that of methane (CO 2 –ECBM). At present, most CO 2 –ECBM projects are implemented in
deep coal seams, because the coal in deep coal seams cannot be economically exploited, and
the possibility of injected CO 2 returning to the atmosphere is small [ 157 , 158 ]. Displacing
shale gas, after CO 2 is injected into coal seams, the pore structure and chemical and physical
properties of coal will also change, affecting the effect of displacing coalbed gas [ 159 ]. The
decrease of coal seam permeability is the main problem in the whole process. The reduction
of coal seam permeability will affect the production rate of CH 4 , the injection amount and
the injection pressure of CO 2 . The expansion of coal after CO 2 adsorption is the main
reason for this situation [ 160 ].
The properties of coal seams and injected CO 2 affect the expansion of coal bodies. The
higher the coal grade is, the more favorable it is for CO 2 to displace CH 4 [ 160 ]. The
increase in coal seam temperature will lead to the increase of kinetic energy of CO 2
molecules and the decrease of CO 2 adsorption capacity, thus reducing CO 2 reserves and
CH 4 production [ 161 , 162 ] . Compared with gaseous or subcritical CO 2 , supercritical CO 2
is more easily affected by coal seam temperature [ 163 ]. With regard to temperature, the
combined effects of thermal expansion, thermal cracking and gas phase transition should
also be considered [ 164 ]. The presence of water in coal seams also signiﬁcantly affects the



-----


_Energies_ **2023** , _16_ , 2865 20 of 48

adsorption and desorption of CO 2 and CH 4 . Water, CH 4 and CO 2 in coal compete with
each other in the adsorption position, which affects the effect of displacing coalbed methane.
The H 2 O molecules on the coal will induce the expansion of the coal matrix, resulting in
the reduction of the porosity and permeability of the coal seam. Water molecules trapped
in the pores may also block the channel for CH 4 desorption from coal [ 165 – 167 ].
Hou et al. [ 161 ] found that the injection pressure of CO 2 affects the displacement and
migration rate of CH 4 , and increasing the pressure can increase the storage of CO 2 and the
recovery of methane. Increasing temperature or pressure will also shorten the adsorption
equilibrium time of CO 2 and CH 4 [ 168 ]. Perera et al. [ 169 ] found that under higher
CO 2 injection pressure, pore elasticity will increase porosity, which is more inﬂuential
than adsorption expansion. However, some scholars found that higher CO 2 injection
pressure may also lead to coal matrix expansion, which will reduce the permeability of
coal seams, and the reduction of supercritical CO 2 will be greater [ 160 , 163 ]. Therefore, the
CO 2 injection pressure should be reasonably determined according to the actual situation
of the coal seam. The captured CO 2 usually contains impurities (Such as N 2 ). Injecting
mixed gas (CO 2 /N 2 ) can improve the replacement efﬁciency of CH 4 and promote the
recovery of CH 4 [ 170 – 172 ]. In the process of CO 2 ﬂooding coalbed methane, compared
with gaseous CO 2 ﬂow, supercritical CO 2 ﬂow can exchange better with CH 4 , and the sweep
efﬁciency of supercritical CO 2 injection is higher, resulting in a longer expansion period.
The effectiveness of supercritical CO 2 in CH 4 recovery has nothing to do with the maturity
or grade of the coal seam [ 169 , 173 , 174 ]. The viscosity of gaseous CO 2 increases with
temperature, while the change of supercritical CO 2 is the opposite. Because the temperature
of the underground coal seam is higher, compared with gaseous CO 2 , supercritical CO 2 has
a stronger sliding capacity and a shorter contact time with the coal matrix, which reduces
its adsorption capacity [ 162 ].

4.1.4. Enhanced Geothermal Technology

Geothermal is a good alternative energy. CO 2 -enhanced geothermal technology
( CO 2 –EGS ) uses supercritical CO 2 as the heat transfer ﬂuid and uses a method similar to
hydraulic fracturing to activate the cracks in the rock so that CO 2 can extract heat from the
rock through the rock. Supercritical CO 2 has many advantages. First, it has a large expan-
sion rate and low viscosity, thereby reducing the power consumption of ﬂuid circulation
and improving the speed of ﬂuid circulation. Secondly, CO 2 is a non-polar solvent, which
will reduce the dissolution of rock minerals and eliminate scaling problems. Finally, CO 2
may be an attractive ﬂuid for heat, so it has advantages in accelerating energy uptake. In
the process of geothermal exploitation, attention should also be paid to the inﬂuence of
CO 2 injection temperature and pressure. Lower CO 2 injection temperature is favorable
for thermal extraction [ 175 ]. The higher the CO 2 injection rate, the worse the heat transfer
effect. Therefore, when the CO 2 injection rate is high enough, the heat transfer between
the wellbore and the surrounding reservoir can be ignored, thus extending the service
life [ 176 ]. The nature of the reservoir will also affect CO 2 –EGS. Wang et al. [ 177 ] found
that lower reservoir permeability and initial reservoir temperature are more favorable for
CO 2 –EGS. And with the increase of formation permeability, the efﬁciency of heat extraction
increases, but the rate decreases. The rock chemical and mechanical interaction caused
by supercritical CO 2 in the pores will affect the ﬂow behavior, change the porosity and
permeability of the reservoir, and affect the energy extraction process, but the current
research in this ﬁeld is less [ 178 ].

_4.2. Chemical Conversion Technology_

CO 2 chemical conversion technology mainly uses CO 2 to produce fuels and chemicals,
which can provide additional value and may store CO 2 [ 179 ]. Due to the thermodynamic
stability and kinetic inertia of CO 2 molecules, the direct synthesis of CO 2 usually has the
disadvantages of low synthesis efﬁciency and harsh reaction conditions. At present, only a
few chemicals in industry are made of CO 2 . Although the utilization potential of CO 2 as a

chemical raw material is limited, it can reduce the dependence of the chemical industry on
traditional fossil fuels. Table 4 is an example of chemicals currently used for CO 2 synthesis
at the pilot scale as summarized by Burkart et al. [ 134 ]. In the following section, we will
introduce some CO 2 conversion methods and their future challenges.

4.2.1. Raw Materials for the Chemical Industry

At present, scholars and institutions around the world have developed many chemical
routes for CO 2 utilization. Most of these routes only consider the possibility of synthesis
and do not consider the reduction potential or potential proﬁtability of CO 2 . The direct
conversion of CO 2 is mostly to reduce CO 2 to CO through reverse water gas shift (RWGS)
reaction, and then to hydrogenate CO to the required chemicals [ 180 ]. Otto et al. [ 181 ]
evaluated 123 reaction routes of CO 2 conversion into chemicals. The authors selected the
types of these reactions that can meet the standards based on the potential of reducing
the amount of CO 2 and the economic beneﬁts of synthesis. Among the six selected bulk
chemicals (methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, oxalic acid, urea and dimethyl ether),
ﬁve of them are CO 2 and H 2 reactions. Therefore, CO 2 catalytic hydrogenation is the most
potential technology and the technology most likely to be applied on a large scale in a
short term. Figure 11 shows the different transformation routes of applying renewable
energy to CO 2 hydrogenation. Kondratenko et al. [ 182 ] analyzed the current situation
of converting CO 2 into chemicals through catalytic hydrogenation, photocatalysis and
electrocatalysis. Among them, the catalytic hydrogenation of CO 2 to methanol and methane
has formed a commercial scale, while electrocatalysis and photocatalysis still require
signiﬁcant technological and catalytic progress [ 183 ]. At the same time, the authors also
mentioned that the most critical problem of catalytic hydrogenation is the need for cheap
and clean H 2 . This is also the development trend of CO 2 catalytic hydrogenation in the
future. Although the large-scale application of CO 2 electrocatalysis technology still faces
challenges, with the development of technology, it is considered to be one of the most
promising technologies in the future. Many researchers have proposed various methods
to promote the development of electrocatalysis technology, such as increasing active sites
on electrodes, using alloy catalysts, etc. [ 184 – 186 ]. Park et al. [ 185 ] believed that low
productivity and product separation difﬁculties caused by low current density and Faraday
efﬁciency were the main factors hindering the large-scale application of electrochemical
conversion. However, by introducing cutting-edge equipment (zero gap electrolytic cells,
etc.), large-scale application of electrochemical conversion can be possible. In addition, the
lack of in situ observation of the reaction mechanism and active sites during electrocatalytic
experiments also hindered its development. Coupling electrocatalytic technology with
renewable energy is an important development direction in the future.

In order to utilize CO 2 efﬁciently, catalysts are usually used to reduce the activation en-
ergy during the chemical conversion of CO 2 [ 188 , 189 ]. At present, research on CO 2 catalytic
reduction focuses on the formation of C1 products. Different C1 products are controlled
by the reduction degree, which is also a major challenge [ 134 ]. The preparation method
of the catalyst usually affects its speciﬁc surface area, particle size, metal dispersion and
other properties, thus affecting the activity and selectivity of the catalyst [ 190 ]. Therefore,
an appropriate preparation method must be selected when preparing the catalyst [ 191 ].
Doping and alloying of foreign atoms can change the surface morphology of the catalyst,
which is an effective method to improve the activity and selectivity of the catalyst [ 186 ]. At
present, the price of catalysts is relatively expensive, and the conversion rate is not high,
continuous and stable production is difﬁcult, so the future needs more in-depth research.
For renewable energy, the utilization of CO 2 is a great opportunity to help it inject into
the chemical production process [ 187 ]. At the same time, renewable energy sources such
as wind energy and solar energy have shortcomings such as intermittency and anti-peak
shaving, and their introduction into the CO 2 conversion process is considered to be an ideal
method for efﬁcient electric energy storage and conversion [ 186 ]. As shown in Figure 12 ,
CO 2 photocatalytic conversion is to convert CO 2 into valuable products by using renewable
energy (solar energy) under mild reaction conditions. This process will not pollute the
environment and does not require additional energy [ 192 ]. Titanium dioxide is the most
commonly used catalyst in photocatalytic reactions, but it also has its limitations, such
as low efﬁciency and activity of the catalyst. This problem can be effectively solved by
doping, semiconductor coupling, cocatalyst modiﬁcation, design of photo reactor and other
methods [ 192 – 195 ]. If the price of renewable energy continues to fall, it will be possible to
use renewable energy for CO 2 use through catalytic methods in the future.
The use of CO 2 for fuel production can reduce the use of traditional fossil fuels. This
process usually requires a reforming reaction, such as reforming CO 2 and CH 4 to produce
synthesis gas. At present, dry reforming (DRM), partial oxidation (PO) and steam reforming
(SRM) have been proposed for reforming methane to obtain syngas. The reaction equations
of the three methods are as follows:

It can be seen from the reaction formula that the oxidant used in the three methods
is different, and the oxidant used in DRM is CO 2 . Therefore, it is considered to be the
most promising technology [ 136 ]. However, DRM is a highly endothermic reaction that
needs to be carried out at high temperatures. Therefore, it may induce CH 4 decomposition,
CO disproportionation and other side reactions, leading to coke deposition, adsorption
on the catalyst surface, and ultimately leading to catalyst deactivation and reduction
of conversion [ 196 ]. The formation of coke can be reduced by controlling the reaction
temperature and feed ratio [ 197 ]. Aramouni et al. [ 198 ] believed that bimetallic catalysts
formed by adding a small amount of precious metals or other non-precious metals to
cheap non-precious metals can show good performance in catalysis. This can not only
overcome the shortcomings of rapid deactivation of non-precious metals and high coke
but also reduce the price of catalysts. At the same time, the authors think that Co–Ni
bimetallic catalyst has great development potential in the future. The reforming of CO 2
and methane is not only affected by the catalyst, Ayodele et al. [ 199 ] found that the partial
pressure of reactants (CO 2 + CH 4 ) will also have a great impact on conversion, yield and gas
production ratio. Although DRM is considered a technology with environmental potential,
its development is limited by its extremely high reaction temperature, long reaction time,
requirements for pure CO 2 and catalyst deactivation [ 136 ].
CO 2 can also be used to produce biofuels such as methanol (CH 3 OH) and dimethyl
ether (CH 3 OCH 3 ). Methanol is widely used in various chemical industries. Although
compared with gasoline, its energy content is low. However, due to its excellent cooling
effect and extremely high anti-knock ability, it is suitable for vehicles driven by internal
combustion engines [ 133 , 200 ]. At present, methanol production by CO 2 hydrogenation
catalysis is the most studied, and its reaction formula is shown in (4):

CO 2 + 3H 2 _→_ CH 3 OH + H 2 O ∆ H 298K = _−_ 49.5 KJ/mol

is diﬀerent, and the oxidant used in DRM is CO 2 . Therefore, it is considered to be the m
promising technology [136]. However, DRM is a highly endothermic reaction that nee
to be carried out at high temperatures. Therefore, it may induce CH 4 decomposition, C
disproportionation and other side reactions, leading to coke deposition, adsorption on
catalyst surface, and ultimately leading to catalyst deactivation and reduction of conv
sion [196]. The formation of coke can be reduced by controlling the reaction temperatu
and feed ratio [197]. Aramouni et al. [198] believed that bimetallic catalysts formed
adding a small amount of precious metals or other non-precious metals to cheap n
precious metals can show good performance in catalysis. This can not only overcome
shortcomings of rapid deactivation of non-precious metals and high coke but also redu
the price of catalysts. At the same time, the authors think that Co–Ni bimetallic catal
has great development potential in the future. The reforming of CO 2 and methane is
only aﬀected by the catalyst, Ayodele et al. [199] found that the partial pressure of re
tants (CO 2 + CH 4 ) will also have a great impact on conversion, yield and gas product
ratio. Although DRM is considered a technology with environmental potential, its dev
opment is limited by its extremely high reaction temperature, long reaction time, requi
ments for pure CO 2 and catalyst deactivation [136].

CO 2 can also be used to produce biofuels such as methanol (CH 3 OH) and dimet

ether (CH 3 OCH 3 ). Methanol is widely used in various chemical industries. Although co
pared with gasoline, its energy content is low. However, due to its excellent cooling eﬀ

Although it has good thermodynamic properties, it still needs to use appropriate
catalysts to overcome the obstacle of high activation energy. At the same time, a highly
selective catalyst should be used in the reaction process to avoid generating other hydro-
genation products (such as higher alcohols) [ 201 ]. In methanol synthesis, the efﬁciency
of using a Cu catalyst alone is not high, while the supported Cu-based catalyst shows a
strong loading effect. Cu/ZnO catalysts have been widely studied for CO 2 hydrogenation
to methanol [ 202 ]. ZnO can not only enhance the adsorption of CO 2 on the surface of
Cu but also promote the dispersion of copper, thus improving the reactivity of Cu [ 203 ].
Kattel et al. [ 204 ] studied the active sites on the Cu/ZnO catalyst. They believed that the
surface oxidation of ZnCu alloy occurred during methanol synthesis, which oxidized the

surface Zn to ZnO, making the activity of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu the same under the same
Zn coverage. The addition of oxides to the Cu/ZnO catalyst can effectively improve the
performance of the catalyst. The most commonly used oxide is Al 2 O 3 [ 205 ]. Due to the
rich oxygen utilization rate and good ion exchangeability of the ZrO 2 surface, it is also
often studied for binding with Cu/ZnO. The hydrophilicity of ZrO 2 is weaker than that
of Al 2 O 3 , which can improve the dispersion and stability of Cu. In addition, ZrO 2 can
increase the alkalinity of the catalyst, which is conducive to improving the selectivity of the
catalyst [ 206 ]. In addition to improving traditional Cu/ZnO-based catalysts, many scholars
are also developing new catalytic systems [ 207 ].
Dimethyl ether (DME) is also widely used in the chemical industry, and it is also an
effective substitute for fossil fuels. In addition, it produces less NO x , SO x and particulate
matter during combustion, which has little environmental pollution. At the same time, its
cetane number is higher than that of methanol, so it is more suitable as a substitute for
diesel [ 208 ]. DME is usually produced by indirect synthesis and direct synthesis, as shown
in Figure 13 . Indirect synthesis is to ﬁrst synthesize methanol through synthesis gas and
then dehydrate methanol to produce dimethyl ether. The reaction equations are shown in
(5) and (6). Direct synthesis is catalyzed by CO 2 hydrogenation, and the reaction formula is
shown in (7).

Compared with other CO 2 conversion methods, CO 2 methanation has many ad-
vantages. It can directly use existing natural gas pipelines for transportation. As far as
thermodynamics is concerned, CO 2 methanation is the most favorable, so this reaction
is much faster than other CO 2 conversion reactions. Sahebdelfar et al. [ 215 ] studied the
thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of CO 2 methanation. The results show that CO 2
methanation has a high conversion rate at a low temperature of 200~300 __ _◦_ C. Above 350 __ _◦_ C ,
equilibrium conversion can be achieved by using the most advanced catalyst, which shows
the potential and importance of catalyst improvement. Ni-based catalyst is the most
frequently studied catalyst in CO 2 methanation. Because of its low price, it has more
commercial value. Tada et al. [ 216 ] performed CO 2 methanation on four supports, CeO 2 ,
α -Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and MgO (all containing 10% metallic Ni), and observed their effects on CO 2
conversion rate and CH 4 selectivity. It can be seen from Figure 14 that compared with other
catalysts, Ni/CeO 2 catalyst has a higher CO 2 conversion rate, and its selectivity to CH 4 is
close to 1 at a low temperature (250~400 __ _◦_ C). Graca et al. [ 217 ] studied CO 2 methanation
over catalysts containing Ni and Ce supported on HNaUSY zeolite. The authors found
that the performance of the catalyst was better with the increase of Ni content, and the
presence of Ce further improved the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. In recent years,
many researchers have developed a new dual-functional material (DFM) that combines
adsorption and methanation functions for the co-capture and methanation of CO 2 . This
material can combine the two processes of CO 2 adsorption and hydrogenation in a single
reactor [ 218 ]. Although the reaction of CO 2 methanation is simple, the reaction mechanism
is difﬁcult to establish. Even for CO methanation, there is still no consensus on the kinetics
and mechanism [ 219 ].

The mineralization of CO 2 is not only an effective way of utilization but also can
effectively ﬁx CO 2 . Both natural silicate ores and alkaline solid waste can be used for
CO 2 mineralization. However, the use of natural ores for CO 2 mineralization is costly
and challenging [ 220 ]. In contrast, the use of alkaline solid waste for mineralization has
become an attractive approach. Because it has high reactivity and inherent alkalinity and
is easy to obtain. Common alkaline solid wastes include steel slag, cement and concrete
waste, etc. Accelerating CO 2 carbonization by using alkaline solid waste can not only
capture CO 2 efﬁciently from industrial ﬂue gas but also form various products, such as
CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 . As shown in Figure 15 , CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 can be widely used in
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, construction, paper making and other industries. This can
not only solve the problem of alkaline solid waste treatment but also make effective use
of CO 2 [ 221 ]. Recently, the use of steel slag for CO 2 mineralization has aroused great
research interest. Among many alkaline solid wastes, steel slag has the highest CO 2 storage
potential [ 222 ]. Ukwattage et al. [ 223 ] studied the inﬂuence of CO 2 pressure, temperature
and water–solid ratio on the CO 2 mineralization of steel slag. The authors found that the
higher the CO 2 pressure, the faster the carbonization, and the more water in the reactor, the
better the sealing effect. At the same time, the temperature has a dual effect, and about 50 __ _◦_ C
is the optimal temperature for the reaction system. The National Academy of Sciences
believes that mineral carbonization is one of the effective methods for CO 2 utilization,
because of its large scale, energy saving and thermodynamic advantages. Through life
cycle analysis (LCA), it was found that mineral carbonization can effectively reduce net
CO 2 emissions [ 224 ]. The process of CO 2 mineralization requires grinding, heating and
slurry stirring, which consumes a lot of energy. In the future, the energy in the exothermic
reaction should be recovered to compensate for the energy consumption in the process of
CO 2 mineralization, to make the CO 2 mineralization economical.

and grow in a CO 2 -rich environment. The harvested algal biomass can be used to produce
biofuels. It is considered a substitute for fossil energy and can alleviate the global energy
crisis. Figure 16 shows the process required to convert microalgae into biofuel. Different
methods can be used to convert microalgae into biofuel (such as biodiesel, bioethanol,
etc.) [ 225 ]. Biomass can be selectively converted into different biofuels according to their
quality and composition. For example, sugar-rich biomass is suitable for the production of
bioethanol, and saturated lipid-rich biomass is suitable for the production of biodiesel [ 209 ].
However, from the current research results, it is uneconomical to use microalgae to produce
biofuels. This is mainly because a large amount of energy is required in the process of
extracting lipids from algae cells and transesteriﬁcation. Algal culture is one of the focuses
of research. Culture temperature, CO 2 concentration, salinity, light and pH value will
affect the process of CO 2 ﬁxation by microalgae [ 11 , 226 ]. Different microalgae species are
suitable for different environments. ArunK. Vuppaladadiyam et al. [ 227 ] believed that the
CO 2 ﬁxation rate of microalgae was too low, and it was necessary to improve the CO 2
absorption rate or use cheap photobioreactors to compete with mature CCS technology.
Otherwise, cultured microalgae are more suitable for conversion into biofuels or chemicals.
Bioutilization technology also includes bioelectrochemical systems (BES) [ 228 ]. Its essence
is to use microorganisms as catalysts to conduct synthesis reactions in the electrochemical
cell. Compared with chemical catalysts, biocatalysts have higher speciﬁcity and versatil-
ity [ 229 ]. One possible application of the bioelectrochemical system is the electrochemical
reduction of CO 2 to methane, but there are still many challenges [ 230 ]. In recent years, the
absorption-microalgae composite CO 2 capture technology has attracted more attention,
because it can overcome the key challenges of high regeneration energy consumption and
low CO 2 concentration in the microalgae solution. Future research should focus on the
combination of alkaline solution absorption and microalgae transformation synergistic
mechanism [ 84 ].

Food-grade CO 2 is mainly used to produce carbonated beverages, deoxidized water,
dairy products and food preservation. Liquid CO 2 and dry ice are mainly used for the
preservation of foods that need freeze-drying. The production of beer, soft drinks and
sparkling wine will also consume a large amount of liquid CO 2 [ 11 ]. CO 2 can also be used
as a solvent to extract hops, decaffeinate coffee and tea, and extract spices and essential
oils from plant materials. Compared with traditional solvents, CO 2 as a solvent has many
advantages, such as being non-toxic, highly stable, low cost, renewable, easy to prepare,
etc. Moreover, the amount of CO 2 used as a solvent is less than that of a conventional
solvent. [ 136 ] Conde-Hernandez et al. [ 231 ] compared three extraction methods of rosemary
essential oil, steam distillation, hydro distillation and supercritical CO 2 , and found that

non-thermal pasteurization technology, and high-pressure CO 2 (HPCD) is one of them.
It can be carried out at a temperature lower than that of traditional heat treatment. The
germicidal efﬁcacy of HPCD has been extensively tested on various microorganisms, so
this process can be applied to the food industry. However, the lack of research on its impact
on food quality hinders its development [ 233 ].

**5. CO** **2** **Storage**

CO 2 storage technology is essential to mitigate global warming. It is the best option
for reducing atmospheric CO 2 in the short to medium term. IPCC (2014) estimated that
5000~10,000 million tons of CO 2 must be captured and stored every year by the middle of
this century. CO 2 storage can be simply divided into geological storage and marine storage.

In Section 3 , it was stated that CO 2 can be used to improve the recovery of oil, natural
gas and coalbed methane, and injected CO 2 can be permanently stored there. In addition,
depleted oil and gas reservoirs can also be directly used to store CO 2 , but this will not
produce economic beneﬁts. The geological storage of CO 2 is the main storage method of
CO 2 at present. As shown in Figure 17 , geological storage sites mainly include depleted oil
and gas ﬁeld reservoirs, deep saltwater layers and non-exploitable coal seams. Depleted
oil and gas reservoirs are considered to be the best storage sites for the following reasons:
(i) some existing infrastructure can be utilized, including injection wells and pipelines, etc.;
(ii) the oil and gas reservoir itself has good sealing property and can store CO 2 for a long
time; (iii) CO 2 can help enhance oil recovery. Saltwater layer storage also has its unique
advantages, such as more CO 2 stored, more economical storage process, wide distribu-
tion, etc., which is considered to have the largest CO 2 storage potential. The technologies
involved in the storage process include a comprehensive survey, site selection, potential
evaluation, drilling technology, injection technology, numerical simulation technology,
monitoring technology, CO 2 escape plugging technology and safety risk assessment. The
development of these technologies can better optimize injection strategies, evaluate reser-
voir capacity, predict CO 2 migration and diffusion, reduce uncertainty and manage leakage
risks [ 234 – 236 ].

Before geological storage, the storage site must be carefully selected. A good storage
site generally includes: sufﬁcient porosity and thickness, tight and complete cap rock, good
injectability and stable geological environment, etc. [ 238 ] During saline aquifer storage,
the location of the aquifer is equally important to the storage process. Too shallow may
cause CO 2 leakage. Too deep will increase the injection pressure of CO 2 , thus increasing
the cost. The chemical composition of aquifer water and formation rock also varies with
the location of the aquifer. This will affect the chemical reaction of CO 2 in the aquifer and
then affect the mineral structure. At present, the research on CO 2 geological storage mainly
focuses on the storage mechanism, storage potential evaluation and storage numerical
simulation, and there is less research on the selection of geological storage areas. This
is because the selection of the storage site is not easy, and there are many factors to
consider. Lu et al. [ 239 ] based on the site selection for CO 2 storage in the Ordos Basin
of China, determined the favorable and candidate areas for CO 2 geological storage by
comprehensively considering technology, safety, reservoir and other aspects. At the same
time, the authors also put forward the site selection and sequencing method of CO 2
geological storage, which provides a reference for the selection of CO 2 geological storage
in carbonate reservoirs. Hsu et al. [ 240 ] developed a multicriteria decision-making model
with eight evaluation criteria to select CO 2 storage sites and applied the ANP method to
this for the ﬁrst time. This method can rank potential CO 2 storage sites and be used for
pre-screening of CO 2 geological storage sites. Mi et al. [ 241 ] analyzed the factors affecting
CO 2 storage based on the characteristics of the Junggar Basin in China and established an
adaptability evaluation index system for CO 2 storage. At the same time, the adaptability of
CO 2 geological storage in the Junggar basin is being evaluated by combining AHP and a
fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Through the evaluation results, the location with
the best suitability is determined.
There are also many mechanisms involved in CO 2 geological storage, and the effec-
tiveness of the CO 2 storage mechanism determines the efﬁciency of geological storage [ 242 ].
The geological storage of CO 2 is affected by many factors, such as temperature, pressure,
CO 2 injection rate, the salinity of formation water, mineral composition of formation rock,
formation thickness, formation dip, contact angle, interfacial tension and porosity, etc. The
higher the pressure, the higher the solubility of CO 2 in brine. This is mainly because the
higher the pressure, the greater the thrust. The higher the temperature, the lower the solubil-
ity of CO 2 in the brine. This is mainly because the higher temperature provides the system
with heat energy. When it overcomes the bond energy between CO 2 molecules and brine
molecules, the solubility of CO 2 starts to decrease [ 243 , 244 ]. Wildenschild et al. [ 245 ] found
that a lower CO 2 injection rate can store more CO 2 . Jing et al. [ 246 ] found that the CO 2
storage is inversely proportional to the formation dip. At the same time, the larger the dip
angle is, the more obvious the inﬂuence on CO 2 migration distance is. Because accelerating
the dissolution of CO 2 in brine can reduce the risk of leakage, some scholars have proposed
some new technologies to accelerate the dissolution of CO 2 [ 247 ]. Hassanzadeh et al. [ 248 ]
proposed a method to accelerate the dissolution of CO 2 in brine. This method can increase
the dissolution fraction of CO 2 in 200 years from 8% to 50% by injecting salt water into the
top of CO 2 .
As shown in Figure 18 , when CO 2 is injected into the reservoir for the ﬁrst time, the risk
of leakage is very high. When storing CO 2 , the main problem is to consider the potential
leakage during injection and whether CO 2 will leak over time. Therefore, when CO 2 is
stored for a long time, the caprock must have good sealing capacity. The low permeability
of the caprock is critical to prevent CO 2 leakage [ 237 ]. When CO 2 leaks, CO 2 itself will not
affect the quality of groundwater, but the dissolution of CO 2 will reduce the pH value of
groundwater, thus enhancing the dissolution of minerals. Some minerals contain harmful
trace elements, which may affect the quality of groundwater [ 249 ]. When storing CO 2 in
the saltwater layer, the chemical reaction of CO 2 dissolution in the formation ﬂuid and
the interaction of CO 2 water rock should also be considered [ 250 ]. Jayasekara et al. [ 250 ]

Some monitoring technologies can be used to monitor and predict the potential mi-
gration path and escape point of CO 2 , so as to prevent CO 2 leakage. Geophysical and
geochemical methods are widely used in CO 2 leakage monitoring [ 252 ]. Among the geo-
physical methods, the geoelectric method is often used to monitor CO 2 migration, because
the subsurface resistivity is affected by CO 2 [ 253 ]. Using 4D (delayed) seismic data is
the most reliable method to determine the migration mode of CO 2 in the reservoir and
can be used to track the evolution of CO 2 plumes [ 1 , 251 ]. Pressure monitoring during
CO 2 injection and storage is a key tool. During the injection process, pressure monitor-
ing combined with InSar technology can effectively monitor the leakage of CO 2 into the
caprock [ 236 ]. Zeidouni et al. [ 254 ] proposed a leak detection and characterization method
through pressure monitoring. They ﬁrst gave the relationship between the pressure change
of the upper aquifer and the leakage parameters. Then monitor the pressure of the upper
aquifer through the monitoring well, and analyze the pressure response caused by the
leakage to locate and characterize the leakage. At the same time, more accurate information
can be obtained by increasing the number of monitoring wells. Zeidouni et al. [ 255 ] studied
the feasibility of CO 2 leakage detection by monitoring temperature changes. The authors
found that the temperature will increase when the brine leaks, while the temperature
will decrease when the CO 2 leaks. Therefore, the leaking ﬂuid can be distinguished by
monitoring the temperature change. The strength of the temperature signal is affected by
the leakage speed. Reducing the leakage speed will reduce the strength of the temperature
signal. At the same time, the temperature change caused by the leakage only covers a small
area around the leakage path, so temperature monitoring along the potential leakage path
is most useful. Isotopes are also used for monitoring CO 2 leakage, which can detect low
level CO 2 leakage [ 256 ]. Magnier et al. [ 257 ] found that carbon isotopes in some reservoirs
are not enough to track CO 2 leakage on the surface, and they found that inert gas is more
suitable for monitoring leakage. Remote sensing technology can also be used to monitor
CO 2 leakage, commonly used to measure surface deformation, temperature anomaly and
vegetation damage [ 258 ].

_5.2. Ocean Storage_

The ocean can absorb a large amount of CO 2 through the natural exchange be-
tween water and the atmosphere. The storage capacity of seawater is estimated to be
5000~10,000 GtC . However, the process is slow and limited to surface seawater, so some
scholars have suggested that the CO 2 ocean storage process can be accelerated and the

ocean’s ability to absorb CO 2 can be improved by directly injecting CO 2 . Therefore, this sec-
tion will focus on direct injection strategies that can be applied on an industrial scale. The
way to implement ocean storage of CO 2 is shown in Figure 19 . Usually, CO 2 is transported
to the storage site by ship or pipeline and injected into the ocean. The phase state and
density of CO 2 are different with different injection depths, and the storage effect is also
different. Generally, with the increase of CO 2 injection depth, the retention of CO 2 increases.
Above 500 m, CO 2 is gaseous and below it is liquid. The density of CO 2 above 3000 m
is less than that of seawater, and the density of CO 2 below 3000 m is greater than that of
seawater. Therefore, when CO 2 is injected above 3000 m, CO 2 will rise due to positive
buoyancy, causing part of CO 2 to ﬂoat to the surface water before dissolution and enter
the atmosphere again [ 259 ]. When CO 2 is injected below 3000 m, CO 2 should be subject to
negative buoyancy and sink, so a liquid CO 2 “lake” will be formed on the seabed, thereby
minimizing the risk of CO 2 leakage. Although compared with geological storage, marine
storage seems to be safer. However, most CO 2 will dissolve in the surrounding seawater
before reaching the seabed, and the CO 2 “lake” may also be disturbed by the ocean current.
In addition, due to the inﬂuence of chemical potential, the CO 2 “lake” will also continue
to dissolve, which will change the CO 2 concentration and pH value of the seabed and
affect the marine ecosystem [ 260 ]. And the more concentrated the emission of CO 2 , the
greater its potential impact [ 261 ]. Widdicombe et al. [ 262 ] studied the impact of seabed
CO 2 leakage on macrobenthic animals. The authors found that CO 2 leakage will have a
signiﬁcant impact on seabed animals, but the impact may disappear soon. The seabed
fauna community will quickly recover to its original state, depending on the species of
fauna and the characteristics of the habitat. Some scholars proposed storing CO 2 in deep-
sea sediments, where CO 2 is in a liquid state and its density is higher than the overlying
interstitial ﬂuid so that the injected CO 2 remains gravitationally stable. This overcomes the
problem of CO 2 escaping due to its buoyancy when geologically storing CO 2 [ 263 ].

Another CO 2 storage method is to store CO 2 through hydrate. Under the conditions
of high pressure and low temperature in the deep sea, the interaction between CO 2 and
seawater will be conducive to the formation of CO 2 hydrate. CO 2 molecules in CO 2 hydrate
are locked in solid cages formed by water molecules, preventing CO 2 from dissolving into
seawater. The formation and stability of CO 2 hydrate are affected by the depth and ocean
thermal gradient. Figure 20 shows the phase equilibrium of CO 2 hydrate superimposed

bounded by AB, while in sediment, the stable area is bounded by BC. The exact depth of
these points is affected by the speciﬁc water and geological conditions at each location [ 260 ].
When CO 2 is injected into deep-sea sediments, the formation of CO 2 hydrate will reduce
the effective porosity and permeability, thus blocking the ﬂow of liquid CO 2 and acting
as the second sealing cap above the injection site [ 2 ]. Li et al. [ 2 ] studied the formation
mechanism of a self-sealing cap related to CO 2 hydrate and discussed the feasibility of
storing CO 2 in deep-sea sediments. Through modeling, it is found that the critical time
of CO 2 leakage has a strong correlation with reservoir properties and wellbore injection
conditions. Qanbari et al. [ 264 ] found that the formation of CO 2 hydrate and the gravity
stability of CO 2 can prevent the leakage of CO 2 in the upper part of marine sediments. If
CO 2 is injected into the appropriate ocean depth and sediment depth, CO 2 can be reliably
sealed in the sediment. As with geological storage, CO 2 monitoring is also required during
ocean storage to prevent CO 2 leakage. Shitashima et al. [ 265 ] proposed a method for
detecting and monitoring CO 2 leakage from the seabed. The steps of this method are
summarized in Figure 21 . The ﬁrst is to detect CO 2 leaks using seaﬂoor-based acoustic
section tomographic scanning. Once a leak is detected, the pH/pCO 2 sensor and side scan
sonar installed on the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are used to map the leakage
point. Finally, the remote underwater vehicle (ROV) or automatic elevator, or the Towing
Multi Layer Monitoring System (TMLMS) are used to monitor the CO 2 diffusion behavior.

Keywords are a high-level summary of the article and the core research content of the
literature. Through the keyword co-occurrence map, we can analyze the current research
hotspots and grasp the future research direction. The larger the node, the more frequently
keywords appear. Therefore, it can be seen from Figure 22 that the current research focus
in this ﬁeld is CO 2 capture and storage. Among them, in CO 2 capture, the adsorption
method is the research hotspot, while activated carbon is the research hotspot in the
adsorption method. The main reason is that the price of activated carbon is low and the
source is wide, which can signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of carbon capture. Ionic liquids
and metal–organic frameworks are also the current research hotspots, mainly because they
can be functionalized by introducing functional groups and other methods to improve
their CO 2 capture capacity. In CO 2 storage, the injection process has been studied more,
because the risk of CO 2 leakage during the injection process is the highest. As for storage
sites, the saline aquifers are the focus of current research, mainly due to their large storage
potential, wide distribution and fewer restrictions. CO 2 utilization has not formed such
a large node as storage and capture, because there are many CO 2 utilization routes, and
there are no particularly advantageous utilization routes, all of which have more or fewer
disadvantages. At present, the research focuses on the catalyst for CO 2 chemical conversion
and the production of biofuels. Copper-based catalysts have attracted more attention. It
is widely used in CO 2 catalytic hydrogenation to methanol. Methanol can be used to
supplement or partly replace petroleum fuels, so methanol from CO 2 has broad application
prospects and is of great signiﬁcance to the utilization of CO 2 . Using microalgae and other
microorganisms to convert CO 2 into biofuels is also a research hotspot. It can also be used
to replace traditional petroleum fuels, and these biofuels may be carbon negative.

Based on the keyword map, CiteSpace is used for clustering analysis, and the clustering
map shown in Figure 23 is obtained. It can be seen from Figure 23 that the cluster module
value Q = 0.7714 &gt; 0.3, and the cluster average contour value S = 0.8951 &gt; 0.5, indicating that
the cluster is reasonable and the cluster structure is signiﬁcant. Cluster analysis generated
a total of 13 categories. Cluster 0 # is an ionic liquid, which is a new “green solvent” and
is widely used in the ﬁeld of gas absorption. At present, the research focus in this ﬁeld is
to connect ionic liquids with speciﬁc functional groups to obtain functional ionic liquids,
so as to improve their CO 2 capture capacity. Of course, reducing the production price of
ionic liquids is also the future research direction. Cluster 1 #, 7 #, 11 # and 14 # are all
about CO 2 storage. The main reason is that CO 2 storage technology is one of the most
effective technologies to achieve the goal of carbon neutralization, and it can store a large
amount of CO 2 . On the other hand, when CO 2 is sequestered, it can also be used for oil
displacement, and coalbed methane displacement, generating additional economic beneﬁts.
Therefore, it has attracted extensive attention from all countries in the world. Cluster 2 #
assessment is also related to CO 2 storage. Before CO 2 storage, the reservoir capacity needs
to be evaluated to ensure that the reservoir has the capacity to store CO 2 on a large scale. It
is also necessary to evaluate the integrity of the caprock to prevent CO 2 leakage through the
caprock. The hydrogeological environment and geological structure of the storage area also
need to be assessed to ensure long-term storage of CO 2 . Cluster 9 # is a carbon credit, which
is an important tool to slow down global warming. Carbon credit trading takes carbon
emission allowances as a scarce resource and has commodity attributes for public trading,
which is the core economic means to achieve carbon emission reduction. But the current
carbon credits lack a uniﬁed standard, hindering globally coordinated action on climate
issues. At the same time, in addition to the inﬂuence of market factors, policy factors
are more likely to affect the carbon trading market. Therefore, it is necessary to establish
a globally uniﬁed carbon emissions trading system, establish a sound carbon emissions
trading market supervision system, and accelerate the construction of a mature carbon
trading market. Cluster 10 # is mineral carbonization, which is similar to CO 2 ﬂooding. It
can not only effectively ﬁx CO 2 , but also may generate additional beneﬁts. Mineralization
of alkaline solid waste is the future research direction, mainly because of its low cost, and it
can also play a certain role in the utilization of solid waste to achieve a win-win situation.
It can also be seen from the side that CO 2 storage, which can generate economic beneﬁts,
is the focus of global scholars. Cluster 12 # is a nanoparticle. The main application of
nanoparticles is the solid adsorption technology of CO 2 . Porous organic polymers (POPs),
metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), mesoporous materials, etc. belong to the category of
nanomaterials. Nanomaterials have large chemical activity and surface energy and are
easy to combine with foreign atoms to form stable structures. As an adsorbent, it has
the following advantages: super adsorption capacity, Wide application range of pH, and
high selectivity. Therefore, nanomaterials are the development focus of solid adsorption
technology in the future.

are China (77), the United States (50), Australia (43), Malaysia (19), the United Kingdom (18),
India (15), Japan (15), South Korea (13), Canada (13), Iran (9) and Germany (9). In addition
to Australia and Malaysia, the carbon emissions of the remaining nine countries are among
the top ten in the world. This shows that these big carbon-emitting countries have all
noticed the impact of greenhouse gases (especially CO 2 ) on the Earth’s environment. At the
same time, these countries have also taken action to support some institutions and scholars
to study how to reduce the CO 2 content in the atmosphere. The number of papers published
by China, the United States and Australia is far ahead of other countries, indicating that
these three countries have more research on CCUS. As can be seen from Figure 24 , China
has more cooperation with Australia and the United States, while other countries have less
cooperation. On the whole, there is little cooperation between countries at present, and

It can be seen from Figure 26 that from 2012 to 2016, the mass transfer process of CO 2 is
a research hotspot, and the capture and storage of CO 2 involve the mass transfer of CO 2 . The
research on the mass transfer process can help capture and store CO 2 better. The research
hotspot from 2013 to 2014 is hydrogen production, mainly because catalytic hydrogenation
of CO 2 is the most potential technology in CO 2 chemical conversion, but the source of
hydrogen is a problem. Only by using renewable energy to produce clean hydrogen, can it
really play a role in the utilization of CO 2 . The research hotspot in 2014–2015 is simulation.
Using software to simulate CO 2 transport and storage processes can help CCUS technology
develop faster. The research hotspot in 2015–2017 is transformation. Through a chemical
reaction, mineralization and biological utilization, CO 2 can be transformed into useful
products to reduce the CO 2 content in the atmosphere. The research hotspot in 2016–2017
is water, and saline water layer has received extensive attention due to its huge storage
potential. The research hotspot in 2016–2018 is a CH 4 model for making it from CO 2 that can
not only reduce the CO 2 content in the atmosphere but also solve the global energy crisis,
which can be said to be killing two birds with one stone. At present, the main problem is
the transformation cost and efﬁciency. The model mainly refers to the decision-making
model, which is used for the selection of CO 2 storage sites. Because the selection of a CO 2
storage site is affected by many factors, and each factor is crisscrossed, it is difﬁcult to make
the optimal choice only by subjective inference and experience. Therefore, a decision model
is established to select the storage site of CO 2 . In recent years, the research focus in the
CCUS ﬁeld is CO 2 storage and supercritical CO 2 . As mentioned earlier, CO 2 storage is an
indispensable part of achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. Supercritical CO 2 has both
gaseous and liquid properties, which makes it widely used. Therefore, it is also the current
research hotspot.

and it is difﬁcult for a single set of equipment to ensure the long-term operation of the
process, with high investment. Low-temperature separation technology has high energy
consumption, and microalgae, chemical chain combustion and electrochemical technology
are difﬁcult to achieve long-term stable operation. At the same time, the ﬂue gas contains a
lot of impurities, which will affect the efﬁciency of CO 2 capture. These impurities will also
affect CO 2 pipeline transportation and threaten the integrity of the pipeline. At present,
there is little research in this area, which needs further in-depth study. In CO 2 -enhanced
energy production, the miscibility of CO 2 and CH 4 will reduce the recovery of CH 4 and
increase the exploitation cost. CO 2 will also affect the surface structure of shale and coal,
resulting in a decrease in CO 2 adsorption capacity and permeability. In the chemical con-
version process of CO 2 , due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertia of CO 2 , the
conversion process is very difﬁcult. Although many CO 2 conversion routes have been
developed, most of them only consider the possibility of reaction and do not consider
economic factors. The main problem of CO 2 catalytic hydrogenation is cheap and clean H 2 .
Photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are currently facing challenges such as low productivity,
difﬁcult product separation and poor catalyst stability. In CO 2 storage, the main problem is
CO 2 leakage. Whether in the injection process or long-term storage process, CO 2 leakage
is the ﬁrst problem to be considered. The unpredictable leakage risk restricts the devel-
opment of CO 2 storage technology. To sum up, we should strengthen the research and
development of CCUS technology, improve the feasibility of the technology, and realize
large-scale commercial promotion and application as soon as possible.

Economic problems are an important factor restricting the development of CCUS
technology. The capture, transportation, utilization and storage of CO 2 are faced with high
costs. Except for large CO 2– EOR projects, other CCUS projects have difﬁculty achieving
proﬁtability. Long-term high-cost investment and low-proﬁt returns make investors lack
investment motivation, which restricts the commercialization of CCUS. Countries should
establish special funds for CCUS, introduce economic incentives and preferential tax
policies, and help enterprises reduce CCUS operating costs. Without government support,
current CCUS projects ﬁnd it difﬁcult to achieve proﬁtability, which seriously affects the
enthusiasm of enterprises to carry out CCUS demonstration projects.

(3) Policy
At present, most countries in the world have not issued policies, laws, regulations,
technical speciﬁcations and standard systems on CCUS. They are important links in the
industrialization development of CCUS, which also restricts the development of CCUS
technology. At the same time, the policies that have been issued are not targeted, and
CCUS needs more speciﬁc support policies. Therefore, countries all over the world should
improve and optimize the CCUS legal and regulatory system as soon as possible, formulate
a scientiﬁc and reasonable standard system for the construction, operation, supervision
and termination of CCUS projects, and standardize CCUS activities. There should be a
multi-industry cooperation mechanism to promote the development of the whole industry
chain of CCUS. Establish a carbon emission trading market, incorporate CCUS into the
carbon emission trading system, accelerate the establishment of carbon emission reduction
methodology for CCUS projects, and provide a theoretical basis for calculating the CO 2
emission reduction of CCUS projects. In addition, with the energy crisis caused by the
conﬂict between Russia and Ukraine, many countries have weakened the implementation
of the carbon neutral target, or even abandoned the carbon neutral target, which also
restricts the development of CCUS technology. Governments should deliver on their
commitment to CCUS and play a key role in facilitating its deployment. At the same time,
an international uniﬁed regulatory framework should be established to encourage the
private sector to actively participate in and invest in CCUS projects, which will accelerate
the commercialization of CCUS technology. In the future, CO 2 may become a resource
needed by various economic sectors, which will help to achieve climate goals.
The development of CCUS technology will not only face the above challenges, but
it may also bring environmental problems. For example, leakage risks are prone to occur
during CO 2 transportation and storage, which will pollute the soil and damage local water
quality, and even cause harm to local people. At the same time, this will affect the public
acceptance of CCUS technology and hinder its development.

**7. Conclusions**

In order to achieve the goal of CO 2 emission reduction, CCUS technology has become
a research hotspot. This paper summarizes various technologies and problems related to
CCUS, and draws the following conclusions:
(1) With the emergence of new solvents such as solvent mixed absorption technology
and ionic liquid absorption technology, solvent absorption technology will still be the ﬁrst
choice for large-scale CO 2 capture in the future. Solid adsorption technology is currently a
research hotspot, especially metal–organic frameworks, whose functional characteristics
make them have great development potential for the future. The development of mixed-
matrix membranes, gas-absorbing membranes, and facilitative membranes has improved
the permeability and selectivity of membrane separation technologies. Low-temperature
separation technology, microalgae, electrochemical looping combustion technology and
electrochemical technology have made some important progress in recent years, but there
is still a long way to go before large-scale commercial use.
(2) Pipeline transportation is the most economical way to transport large amounts of
CO 2 . For long-distance pipeline transportation, dense phase transportation and supercriti-
cal transportation are more economical. In the pipeline design process, the temperature
and pressure changes along the line should be considered to prevent phase changes. At
the same time, it is also important to consider the impact of impurities in CO 2 on pipeline
operation, which will not only affect the phase characteristics and physical parameters of
CO 2 but also threaten the integrity of the pipeline. At present, the relevant knowledge
system of CO 2 pipeline transportation is not perfect and needs further research.
(3) In enhanced energy production technologies, studying the adsorption behavior of
CO 2 is the key to enhancing recovery and increasing storage capacity. At the same time,
attention should be paid to the inﬂuence of CO 2 on the reservoir to prevent the reduction of
the permeability of the reservoir. In the chemical conversion of CO 2 , catalytic hydrogenation

of CO 2 is the most promising technology, but cheap and clean H 2 is currently the main
problem. Coupling electrocatalytic technology with renewable energy is an important
development direction for the future. Catalysts are required for almost all CO 2 chemical
conversions, and catalyst activity and selectivity can be enhanced by doping and alloying
with foreign atoms. CO 2 mineralization requires a large amount of energy, and the energy
in the exothermic reaction should be recovered to make the mineralization economical.
(4) In CO 2 storage, geological storage is currently the main method. The selection
of a storage site is the ﬁrst step of geological storage, but there are few studies on this
aspect at present. The storage mechanism is the theoretical basis of geological storage
and determines the efﬁciency of geological storage. Preventing CO 2 leakage is an issue
that must be considered in geological storage, and CO 2 leakage may pollute groundwater.
At the same time, the impact of geochemical reactions on the caprock cannot be ignored.
At present, the monitoring technology of CO 2 storage is relatively mature and has been
applied in different projects. In ocean storage, the CO 2 injection depth is different, and the
storage effect is also different. Due to factors such as storage costs and the international
law of the sea, ocean storage has not yet entered the stage of practical application.
Finally, the research status, research hotspots and cooperation networks of CCUS
are summarized using CiteSpace software. To sum up, CCUS technology is developing
rapidly, which is a favorable choice to deal with climate change. Although CCUS tech-
nology currently faces some technical challenges, high cost is the key factor hindering
the development of CCUS technology, which limits the large-scale deployment of CCUS
technology. Government ﬁscal policy is a key means to promote the development of CCUS
technology. The government should promote the rapid development of related industries
through direct investment. At the same time, in order to improve public awareness of
the environmental impact, public education and publicity on CCUS technology should
be strengthened.
