**Canada** is a country in North America. Its ten provinces
and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean,
making it the world's second-largest country by total
area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with
the United States is the world's longest international land
border. The country is characterized by a wide range of
both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely
inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority
residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas.
Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest

consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded
nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In
1867, with the union of three British North American
colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as
a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an
accretion of provinces and territories and a process of
increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom,

While a variety of theories have been postulated for the
etymological origins of _Canada_ , the name is now
accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian
word _kanata_ , meaning "village" or "settlement". [8] In
1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec
City region used the word to direct French explorer
Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona. [9] Cartier
later used the word _Canada_ to refer not only to that
particular village but to the entire area subject to
Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); [9] by 1545,
European books and maps had begun referring to this
small region along the Saint Lawrence River as
_Canada_ . [9]

From the 16th to the early 18th century, "Canada"
referred to the part of New France that lay along the
Saint Lawrence River. [10] In 1791, the area became two
British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower
Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the
Canadas until their union as the British Province of
Canada in 1841. [11]

[Upon Confederation in 1867,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Confederation) _Canada_ was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London
Conference and the word _[dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion)_ was conferred as the country's title. [12] By the 1950s, the term
_Dominion of Canada_ was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a "realm of
the Commonwealth". [13]



-----


The _[Canada Act 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Act_1982)_ , which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred
only to _Canada_ . Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to
[Canada Day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Day) [14] The term _Dominion_ was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces,
though after the Second World War the term _federal_ had replaced _dominion_ . [15]

## History

### Indigenous peoples

The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of
the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. [16][17] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at
Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. [18] The
characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal
hierarchies, and trading networks. [19][20] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European
explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through
archeological investigations. [21] Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit,
and Métis, [22] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations
people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity. [22]

A map of Canada showing the percent of self-
reported indigenous identity (First Nations, Inuit,
Métis) by census division, according to the 2021

The Indigenous population at the time of the first
European settlements is estimated to have been between
200,000 [24] and two million, [25] with a figure of
500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on
[Aboriginal Peoples.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_on_Aboriginal_Peoples) [26] As a consequence of European
colonization, the Indigenous population declined by
forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as
the Beothuk, disappeared. [27] The decline is attributed to
several causes, including the transfer of European
diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox, to
which they had no natural immunity, [24][28] conflicts
over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities
and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers
and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-
sufficiency. [29][30]

[Canadian census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Canadian_census) [23]

Although not without conflict, European Canadians'
early interactions with First Nations and Inuit
populations were relatively peaceful. [31] First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the
development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des
bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade. [32] These
early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the
dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties. [33][34] From the late 18th century, European Canadians
forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society. [35] These attempts reached a
climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding
[schools,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system) [36] [health-care segregation,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_hospital) [37] and displacement. [38] A period of redress began with the formation



-----


of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008. [39] This
included recognition of past colonial injustices and settlement agreements and betterment of racial
discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women. [39][40]

### European colonization

It is believed that the first documented European to
explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer
[Leif Erikson.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Erikson) [42][43] In approximately 1000 AD, the
Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was
occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse
aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland. [44]

1750. Possessions of British America (pink),

not indicated. [41]

No further European exploration occurred until 1497,
when seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed
Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of Henry VII of
[England.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England) [45] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier
explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24,
he planted a 10-metre (33  ft) cross bearing the words,
"long live the King of France", and took possession of
the territory New France in the name of King Francis
I. [46] The early 16th century saw European mariners
with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque
and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. [47] In general,
early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the
harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia. [48][49]

In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St John's,
Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp. [50] In 1600, the French established their
first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence. [44] French explorer Samuel de
Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port
Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). [51] Among the colonists of New France, _[Canadiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Canadians)_
extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while
fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed
[to Louisiana.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_(New_France)) [52] The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American
fur trade. [53]

The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in 1610 along with settlements in the
Thirteen Colonies to the south. [54][55] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between
1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years'
[War.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War) [56] Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and
most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. [57]

### British North America

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out
of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. [14] St John's Island (now Prince Edward
Island) became a separate colony in 1769. [59] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the



-----


Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley. [60] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded
Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time
when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against
British rule. [61] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith,
and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an
independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. [62]

The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many
residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British
sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution. [14]

[Quebec City.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City) [58]

After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783
Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed
United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North
American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country. [63] The
American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought
against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival
changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from
Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the
incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick, as Canada's first city. [64] To accommodate the influx of
English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of
Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later
Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly. [65]

The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the
United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no
boundaries were changed. [67] Immigration resumed at a higher
level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and
1850. [68] New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish
Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland
[Clearances.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Clearances) [69] Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33
percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891. [24]

FitzGibbon of an impending

The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive
[Rebellions of 1837.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellions_of_1837) [70] The Durham Report subsequently
recommended responsible government and the assimilation of
French Canadians into English culture. [14] [The Act of Union 1840](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Union_1840)
merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and
responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by
1855. [71] The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon
boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British
colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858). [72] The Anglo-Russian Treaty of



-----


Saint Petersburg (1825) established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US Alaska
Purchase of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC
border. [73]

### Confederation and expansion

Animated map showing the growth and change of
[Canada's provinces and territories since](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_Canada)
Confederation in 1867 [74]

Following three constitutional conferences, the _[British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1867)_
_[North America Act, 1867](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1867)_ officially proclaimed Canadian
Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four
provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New
Brunswick. [75][76] Canada assumed control of Rupert's
Land and the North-Western Territory to form the
Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances
ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the
province of Manitoba in July 1870. [77] British Columbia
and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866)
joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a
transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the
province within 10 years, [78] while Prince Edward
Island joined in 1873. [79] In 1898, during the Klondike
Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament
created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan
became provinces in 1905. [79] Between 1871 and 1896,
almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US. [80]

To open the West and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the
construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), passed the
_[Dominion Lands Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Lands_Act)_ to regulate settlement and established the North-West Mounted Police to assert
authority over the territory. [81][82] This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the
displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to "Indian reserves", [83] clearing the
way for ethnic European block settlements. [84] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western
Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land. [85] The
Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional
hunting lands. [86] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous
peoples moving to the reserves. [87] During this time, Canada introduced the _[Indian Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Act)_ extending its control
over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights. [88]

### Early 20th century

Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act,
1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War. [89] Volunteers
sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the
Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war. [90] Out of approximately 625,000
Canadians who served in the First World War, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were
wounded. [91] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment
the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections
from French-speaking Quebecers. [92] The _Military Service Act_ brought in compulsory military service,

though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated
Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party. [92] In 1919, Canada joined the League of
Nations independently of Britain, [90] and the _[Statute of Westminster, 1931](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster,_1931)_ , affirmed Canada's
independence. [93]

The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship
across the country. [94] In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in
Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s
and 1950s. [95] On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was
declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The
delay underscored Canada's independence. [90]

The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served
in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately 42,000 were killed and another
55,000 were wounded. [96] Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including
the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy,
and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944. [90] Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that
country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi
[Germany.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) [97]

The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada,
Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. [90] Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada
finished the war with a large army and strong economy. [98]

### Contemporary era

The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible
government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor. [99] After two referendums,
Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province. [100]



-----


Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to
the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 1965, [101] the
implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, [102] and the institution of official
multiculturalism in 1971. [103] Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the
Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and
Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions. [104]

Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the
_Canada Act 1982_ , the patriation of Canada's constitution from the
United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the _[Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms)_
_[Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms)_ . [106][107][108] Canada had
established complete sovereignty as an independent country under
[its own monarchy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada) [109][110] In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's
third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal
government. [111]

At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic
changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to
a secular nationalist movement. [112] The radical Front de libération
du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of
bombings and kidnappings in 1970, [113] and the sovereigntist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976,
organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate
Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990. [114] This led to the
formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the
West. [115][116] A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer
margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. [117] In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province
would be unconstitutional, and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated
departure from Confederation. [114]

In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s
and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in
Canadian history; [118] the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female
students; [119] and the Oka Crisis of 1990, [120] the first of a number of violent confrontations between
provincial governments and Indigenous groups. [121] Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a
United States–led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including
the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia. [122] Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but
declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003. [123]

In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War [124] and also
became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s. [125] The country
celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on
January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption. [126] In 2021, the possible graves of
hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential

## Geography

By total area (including its waters), Canada is the
second-largest country in the world, after Russia. [128]

By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having
the world's largest area of fresh water lakes. [129]

Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the
Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in
the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670  km 2

A topographic map of Canada, in polar projection
(for 90° W), showing elevations shaded from
green to brown (higher)

(3,855,100 sq mi) of territory. [130] Canada also has vast
maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of
243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi). [131][132] In addition to
[sharing the world's largest land border with the United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%E2%80%93United_States_border)
States—spanning 8,891  km (5,525  mi) [a] —Canada
shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the
Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans
[Island,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Island) [133] and a maritime boundary with France's
overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the
southeast. [134] Canada is also home to the world's
northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude
82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole. [135]

Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great
Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands,
and the Arctic Archipelago. [136] Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northern
Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest
facilitate productive agriculture. [130] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where
the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output. [130] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of
which are larger than 100 km 2 (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water. [137][138] There are
also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera. [139]

Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount
Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. [140]

### Climate

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be
harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a
continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C
(−40 °F) with severe wind chills. [141] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six
months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a
temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are



-----


generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the
coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges
from 25 to 30  °C (77 to 86  °F), with temperatures in
some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40  °C
(104 °F). [142]

Köppen climate classification types of Canada

Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and
permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain
because the Arctic has been warming at three times the
global average as a result of climate change in
[Canada.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Canada) [143] Canada's annual average temperature over
land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging
from 1.1 to 2.3  °C (2.0 to 4.1  °F) in various regions,
since 1948. [130] The rate of warming has been higher
across the North and in the Prairies. [144] In the southern
regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and
the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning
coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has
resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in
Canada. [145]

### Biodiversity

Canada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine
[ecozones.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecozones_of_Canada) [147] These ecozones encompass over 80,000
classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal
number yet to be formally recognized or discovered. [148]

[Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecozones_of_Canada)
Canada. Ecozones are identified with a unique
colour. Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of
ecozones and are identified with a unique
numeric code. [146]

Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic
[species compared to other countries,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadiverse_countries) [149] due to human
activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in
the country, there are currently more than 800 species at
[risk of being lost.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wildlife_Species_at_Risk_(Canada)) [150] About 65 percent of Canada's
resident species are considered "Secure". [151] Over half
of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of
human development. [152] [The boreal forest of Canada is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreal_forest_of_Canada)
considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with
approximately 3,000,000  km 2 (1,200,000  sq  mi)
undisturbed by roads, cities or industry. [153] Since the
end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of
[eight distinct forest regions,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forests_of_Canada#Regions) [154] with 42 percent of its
land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of
the world's forested land). [155]

Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4
percent designated as protected areas. [156] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are
conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas. [156] Canada's first National Park, Banff
National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi) [157] of mountainous terrain,



-----


with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. [158] Canada's oldest
provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square
kilometres (2,955.01  sq  mi). It is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200
kilometres of streams and rivers. [159] [Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior_National_Marine_Conservation_Area)
largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of lakebed, its
overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23  sq  mi) of islands and
mainland. [160] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area,
which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi) [161] and protects critical breeding and nesting
habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds. [162] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves
cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000 sq mi). [163]

## Government and politics

Canada is described as a "full democracy", [164] with a tradition of
[liberalism,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) [165]  and an [egalitarian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism) [166]  [moderate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_moderate) political

ideology. [167] An emphasis on social justice has been a
distinguishing element of Canada's political culture. [168][169] [Peace,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace,_order,_and_good_government)
order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights,
are founding principles of the Canadian government. [170][171]

Aerial view of Canadian Parliament
Buildings and their surroundings

At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively
centrist parties practising "brokerage politics": [b] the centre-left
[leaning Liberal Party of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada) [178][179] and the centre-right
leaning Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors). [180]

The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the
centre of the political scale. [180] Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the 2021
election—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the Official
Opposition; the New Democratic Party (occupying the left [181][182] ); the Bloc Québécois; and the Green
[Party of Canada.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada) [183] Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian
society. [184][185][186]

Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of
Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. [187][188][189][190] The
reigning monarch is also monarch of 14 other Commonwealth countries (though, all are sovereign of one
another [191] ) and each of Canada's 10 provinces. To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada,
the monarch appoints a representative, the governor general, on the advice of the prime minister. [192][193]

The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada. [190][194][195] However, while the
governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis
[situations,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis) [194] the use of the executive powers (or royal prerogative) is otherwise always directed by the
Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen
and headed by the prime minister, [196] the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the
governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the
political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons. [197] The
Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most
legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the
aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of



-----


Crown corporations and government agencies. [194] The
leader of the party with the second-most seats usually
becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of
an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the
government in check. [198]

The Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the
federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the House of
Commons, and the Senate. While Canada inherited the
British concept of parliamentary supremacy, this was later,
with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but
completely superseded by the American notion of the
[supremacy of the law.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) [200]

The House of Commons in its
temporary location, the West

Each of the 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons
is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. The
_[Constitution Act, 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982)_ , requires that no more than five years pass
between elections, although the _[Canada Elections Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Elections_Act)_ limits this to
four years with a "fixed" election date in October; general elections
still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by
either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in
the House. [201][202] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats
are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. [203]

[Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Block) [199]

Canadian federalism divides government responsibilities between
the federal government and the 10 provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in
parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. [195] Canada's three territories also have
legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the
provinces. [204] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts. [205]

The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country. [206] The minister of finance and minister of
innovation, science, and industry use the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic
policy development. [207] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form
[of Canadian bank notes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_Canadian_dollar) [208] The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal
[Canadian Mint.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mint) [209]

### Law

The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten
conventions. [210] The _Constitution Act, 1867_ (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to
1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and
provincial governments. [211] The _Statute of Westminster, 1931_ , granted full autonomy, and the _Constitution_
_Act, 1982_ , ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the
_Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms_ . [212] The _Charter_ guarantees basic rights and freedoms that
usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and
the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the _Charter_ for a period of five years. [213]

[The Supreme Court of Canada in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada)
Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill

Canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and
has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the
constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court,
final arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard
Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada. [214] The governor general
appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime
minister and minister of justice. [215] The federal Cabinet also
appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial
jurisdictions. [216]

Common law prevails everywhere, except in Quebec, where civil
law predominates. [217] Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout
Canada. [218] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted
by provincial and municipal police forces. [219] In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities
are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police. [220]

Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices
for Indigenous groups in Canada. [221] Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations
between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples. [222] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties, known as the
Numbered Treaties, were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada
between 1871 and 1921. [223] These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council, with
[the duty to consult and accommodate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_consult_and_accommodate) [224] The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were
reaffirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. [222] These rights may include provision of services,
such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation. [225]

### Foreign relations and military

Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in
global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and
international solutions. [227][228][229] Canada's foreign
policy based on international peacekeeping and security
is carried out through coalitions, international

organizations, and the work of numerous federal
institutions. [230][231] The strategy of the Canadian
government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to
meet the Sustainable Development Goals, while also
providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian
crises. [232] [The Canadian Security Intelligence Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service)
(CSIS) is tasked with gathering and analyzing
intelligence to prevent threats such as terrorism,
espionage, and foreign interference, [233] while the
[Communications Security Establishment (CSE) is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Security_Establishment)
focused on cyber security and protecting Canada's digital infrastructure. [233]

Canada and the United States have a long, complex, and intertwined relationship; [234][235] they are close
allies, co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts. [236][237] Canada also
maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France, [238] along with both countries'

former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the _[Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_internationale_de_la_Francophonie)_
_[internationale de la Francophonie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_internationale_de_la_Francophonie)_ . [239] Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the
Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during the Second World War. [97]

Canada has diplomatic and consular offices in over 270 locations in approximately 180 foreign
countries. [226]

Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global
image. [240][241] The Suez Crisis of 1956, saw future prime minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by
proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957
[Nobel Peace Prize.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize) [242] Canada has served in over 50 peacekeeping missions providing the greatest amount
of peacekeepers during the Cold War. [243] Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN
peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined. [244] The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its
participation to UN-sanctioned military operations through NATO, rather than directly through the UN. [245]

Canada has also faced controversy over its involvement in some foreign countries, notably the 1993
[Somalia affair.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia_affair) [246]

As of 2024, Canada's military had over 3000 personnel deployed
[overseas in multiple operations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_military_operations) [248] The unified Canadian Forces
(CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and
Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional,
volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and
27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000
respectively under "Strong, Secure, Engaged" [249] —with a sub-
component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers. [250][c] In
2022, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately
$26.9 billion, or around 1.2 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP)  – placing it 14th for military expenditure by

[Canada is a member of various international organizations and forums.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organisation_membership_of_Canada) [253] [Canada was a founding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_United_Nations)
member of the United Nations in 1945 and formed the North American Aerospace Defense Command
together with the United States in 1958. [254] The country has membership in the World Trade Organization,
the Five Eyes, the G7 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). [227]

The country joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990, [255] and seeks to expand its ties to
Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). [256]

Canada ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and seven principal UN human rights
conventions and covenants since then. [257]

### Provinces and territories

Canada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In
turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and
[Northern Canada (](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Canada) _[Eastern Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Canada)_ refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). [259] Provinces
and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare, [260] as
well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than
the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the
federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the



-----


provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but
rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made
by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform
standards of services and taxation are kept between the
richer and poorer provinces. [261]

Political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces

[and 3 territories[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada)

The major difference between a Canadian province and
a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty
from the Crown [262] and power and authority from the
_Constitution Act, 1867_ , whereas territorial governments
have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of
[Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada) [263] and the commissioners represent the King
[in his federal Council,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King-in-Council) [264] rather than the monarch
directly. The powers flowing from the _Constitution Act,_
_1867_ , are divided between the federal government and
the provincial governments to exercise exclusively [265]

and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment, while changes to the roles and
powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada. [266]

## Economy

Canada has a highly developed mixed-market economy, [268][269]

The Toronto financial district is the
second-largest financial centre in
North America, the seventh-largest
globally in employment and the heart

of Canada's finance industry. [267]

with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023, and a nominal
GDP of approximately US$2.221  trillion. [270] It is one of the
world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized
economy. [271] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services
reached $2.016  trillion. [272] Canada's exports totalled over
$637  billion, while its imported goods were worth over
$631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from
the United States. [272] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods
of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion. [272] The
Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the
world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a
combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion. [273]

Canada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit
[unions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union) [274] It ranks low in the Corruption Perceptions Index (14th in 2023) [275] and "is widely regarded as
among the least corrupt countries of the world". [276] It ranks high in the Global Competitiveness Report
(14th in 2019) [277] and Global Innovation Index (15th in 2023). [278] Canada's economy ranks above most
Western nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom [279] and experiences a
relatively low level of income disparity. [280] The country's average household disposable income per capita
is "well above" the OECD average. [281] Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries
[for housing affordability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing_in_Canada) [282][283] [and foreign direct investment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment) [284][283]

Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has
transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. [285] Like many other
developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about



-----


three-quarters of the country's workforce. [286] Among developed countries, Canada has an unusually
important primary sector, of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent
components. [287] Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby
mines or sources of timber. [288]

Canada's economic integration with the United States has
increased significantly since the Second World War. [290] The
Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened
Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing
industry. [291] [The Canada  – United States Free Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_%E2%80%93_United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement)
Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two
countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in
1994 (later replaced by the Canada–United States–Mexico
[Agreement).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Mexico%E2%80%93Canada_Agreement) [292] As of 2023, Canada is a signatory to 15
free trade agreements with 51 different countries. [289]

Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy. [287][293] [Atlantic Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_drilling_in_Atlantic_Canada)

reserves, constituting the world's third or fourth-largest. [296] Canada is additionally one of the world's
largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies region is one of the most important global
producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. [297] The country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold,
nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and
cadmium. [298][299] Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec,
with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries. [300] The fishing industry is
also a key contributor to the economy. [301]

### Science and technology

In 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9  billion on domestic research and development, with
supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion. [302] As of 2023, the country has produced 15 Nobel
laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine. [303] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of
articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index, [304] and is home to the headquarters
of a number of global technology firms. [305] [Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users)
world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population. [306]

Canada's developments in science and technology include the creation of the modern alkaline battery, [308]

[the discovery of insulin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Discovery) [309] the development of the polio vaccine, [310] and discoveries about the interior
structure of the atomic nucleus. [311] Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial
[cardiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker) [pacemaker,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker) mapping the [visual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex) [cortex,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex) [312][313]  the development of the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope)

[microscope,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope) [314][315] plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology, and the identification of the
first black hole, Cygnus X-1. [316] Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem
cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor, and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi
anemia, cystic fibrosis, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. [313][317]

The Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space
program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research
and developing rockets and satellites. [318] Canada was the third
country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union
and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch. [319]

The Canadian-built Space Shuttle
robotic arm (left), referred to as
Canadarm, transferred the P5 truss
segment over to the Canadian-built
space station robotic arm, referred to
[as Canadarm2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm2) [307]

Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and
is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm,
Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the
ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle. [320] Since the 1960s, Canada's
aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of
satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST. [321] Canada
has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely
used sounding rockets, the Black Brant. [322]

## Demographics

The 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total
population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2
percent over the 2016 figure. [324] It is estimated that
Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023. [325]

The main drivers of population growth are immigration
and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. [326] Canada has
one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the
world, [327] driven mainly by economic policy and also
[family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_categories_(Canada)) [reunification.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_categories_(Canada)) [328][329]  A record 405,000

immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021. [330]

Canada population density map (2014) [323]

Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it
resettled more than 28,000 in 2018. [331] New
immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the
country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. [332]

Canada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the
world. [324] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and
approximately 95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north. [333] About 80 percent
of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States. [334]

Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres. [335] The most
densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City–Windsor
Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence
River. [336][333]

The majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households, 12.1 percent report living alone, and
those living with other relatives or unrelated persons reported at 6.8  percent. [337] Fifty-one  percent of
households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are single-parent households, 2.9 percent are
multigenerational households, and 29.3 percent are single-person households. [337]

### Ethnicity

According to the 2021 Canadian census, over 450 "ethnic or cultural origins" were self-reported by
Canadians. [339] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5  percent), North American
(22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin,
Central and South American (2.5  percent), Caribbean (2.1  percent), Oceanian (0.3  percent), and other
(6 percent). [339][340] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent of Canadians
reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent. [339]

The country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or
cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian [d] (accounting
for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English
(14.7 percent), [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Canadians) (12.1 percent), [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Canadians)

(12.1 percent), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Canadians) (11.0 percent), [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Canadians)

(8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent),
Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent). [345]

The top 168 ethnic or cultural origins self-

reported by Canadians in the 2021 census [341]

Of the 36.3 million people enumerated in 2021,
approximately 25.4 million reported being "White",
representing 69.8  percent of the population. [346] The
Indigenous population representing 5  percent or 1.8
million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the
non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent
from 2016 to 2021. [346] One out of every four
Canadians or 26.5 percent of the population belonged to
a non-White and non-Indigenous visible minority, [347][e] the largest of which in 2021 were South Asian
(2.6 million people; 7.1  percent), Chinese (1.7 million; 4.7  percent), and Black (1.5 million;
4.3 percent). [349]

Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent. [350] In 1961, about 300,000
people, less than two percent of Canada's population, were members of visible minority groups. [351] The
2021 census indicated that 8.3  million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0  percent) of the population,



-----


reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada—above
the 1921 census previous record of 22.3 percent. [352] In 2021, India, China, and the Philippines were the
top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada. [353]

### Languages

Approximately 98 percent of Canadians can

speak either or both English and French: [354]

 English – 57%

 English and French – 16% (Bilingual belts)

 French – 21%

 Sparsely populated area (&lt; 0.4 persons per

km 2 )

A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with
English and French (the official languages) being the
mother tongues of approximately 54  percent and
19  percent of Canadians, respectively. [337] As of the
2021 census, just over 7.8  million Canadians listed a
non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of
the most common non-official first languages include
Mandarin (679,255 first-language speakers), Punjabi
(666,585), Cantonese (553,380), Spanish (538,870),
Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian (319,505),
German (272,865), and Tamil (237,890). [337] [Canada's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_bilingualism_in_Canada)
[federal government practises official bilingualism, which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_bilingualism_in_Canada)
is applied by the commissioner of official languages in
consonance with section 16 of the _[Canadian Charter of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_16_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms)_
_[Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_16_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms)_ and the federal _[Official Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Languages_Act_(Canada))_
_[Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Languages_Act_(Canada))_ . English and French have equal status in federal
courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens
have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to
receive federal government services in either English or
French and official-language minorities are guaranteed
their own schools in all provinces and territories. [355]

Quebec's 1974 _[Official Language Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Language_Act_(Quebec))_ established French as the only official language of the province. [356]

Although more than 82 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial
Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-
speaking population outside Quebec. [357] New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a
French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population. [358] There are also clusters of
Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward
Island. [359]

Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in
courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for
both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages.
In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. [360] There are 11 Indigenous language
groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. [361] Several Indigenous languages have
official status in the Northwest Territories. [362] Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut and is one of
three official languages in the territory. [363]



-----


Additionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous. [364] [American Sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language)
Language (ASL) is used across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary
schools. [365] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec. [366]

### Religion

Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs
and customs. [368] The Constitution of Canada refers to God and the
monarch carries the title of _[Defender of the Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidei_defensor)_ ; however, Canada
has no official church and the government is officially committed to
[religious pluralism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_pluralism) [369] [Freedom of religion in Canada is a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Canada)
constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble
and worship without limitation or interference. [370]

Freedom of religion sculpture by
Marlene Hilton Moore at the
McMurtry Gardens of Justice in

[Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto) [367]

Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the
1970s. [368] With Christianity in decline after having once been
central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, [371] Canada
has become a post-Christian, secular state. [372][373][374] Although
the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in
their daily lives, [375] they still believe in God. [376] The practice of religion is generally considered a private
matter throughout Canadian society and by the state. [377]

According to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Roman Catholics
representing 29.9  percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing
53.3  percent of the population, [f] are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at
34.6 percent. [380] Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent),
Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent). [381] Canada has
the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India. [382]

## Health

Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health
care, informally called Medicare. [383][384] It is guided by the provisions of the _[Canada Health Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Health_Act)_ of
1984 [385] and is universal. [386] Universal access to publicly funded health services "is often considered by
Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they
live in the country." [387] Around 30  percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private
sector. [388] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription
drugs, dentistry and optometry. [388] Approximately 65 to 75  percent of Canadians have some form of
supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service
programs. [389][388]

In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare
expenditures due to a demographic shift toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of
working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years. [337] Life expectancy is 81.1 years. [390] A
2016 report by the chief public health officer found that 88  percent of Canadians, one of the highest
proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they "had good or very good health". [391]

Eighty  percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease:



-----


smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive
alcohol use. [392] Canada has one of the highest rates of adult
obesity among [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD) countries, contributing to

approximately 2.7  million cases of diabetes. [392] Four
chronic diseases—cancer (leading cause of death),

cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes—
account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada. [393][394]

[Health expenditure and financing by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita)
country. Total health expenditure per capita
in US dollars (PPP).

[In 2021, the Canadian Institute for Health Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Institute_for_Health_Information)
reported that healthcare spending reached $308  billion, or
12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year. [395] In 2022,
Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among health-care systems in the
[OECD.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) [396] Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health
indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access
to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources. [397][398] [The Commonwealth Fund's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund)
2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most developed countries ranked Canada second-
to-last. [399] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic
conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental
coverage. [399] An increasing problem in Canada's health system is a lack of healthcare professionals, [400]

and hospital capacity. [401]

## Education

Education in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and
[local governments.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government) [402] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province's curriculum is overseen
by its government. [403][404] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by
secondary and post-secondary education. Education in both English and French is available in most places
across Canada. [405] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded. [406]

Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada. [407] The largest
university is the University of Toronto, with over 85,000 students. [408] Four universities are regularly
ranked among the top 100 worldwide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia,
McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500
worldwide. [409]

According to a 2022 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the
world; [411][412] the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with
over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university
degree. [413] Canada spends an average of 5.3 percent of its GDP on education. [414] The country invests
heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student). [415] As of 2022, 89 percent of adults aged
25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75
percent. [416]

The mandatory education age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years, [417] contributing to an adult literacy rate
of 99 percent. [418] Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme
for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average,
particularly in mathematics, science, and reading, [419][420] ranking the overall knowledge and skills of



-----


Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world,
although these scores have been declining in recent
years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in
reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the
average student scoring 523.7, compared with the
OECD average of 493 in 2015. [421][422]

## Culture

Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range
of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a
["just](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_society) [society"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_society) are constitutionally

Canada by province and territory, showing the
percentage of the population aged 25 to 64 who
had a bachelor's degree or higher, and the

percentage point change from 2016 to 2021 [410]

protected. [424][425][426] Since the 1960s, Canada has
emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its
people. [427][428][429] [The official state policy of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism_in_Canada)
multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's
significant accomplishments [430] and a key distinguishing element of
Canadian identity. [431][432] In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there
is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian
culture. [433] As a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic of regional
ethnic subcultures. [434][435][436]

_[Monument to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_Multiculturalism)_
_[Multiculturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_Multiculturalism)_ by
Francesco Pirelli, in

Toronto [423]

Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is
based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-
right politics, has wide public support. [437] Government policies such as
publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the
outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict
gun control, a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy
termination) and LGBT rights, and legalized euthanasia and cannabis use
are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. [438][439][440]

Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies,
peacekeeping roles, the national park system, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [441][442]

Historically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions.
Through their language, art, and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian
identity. [443] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have
added to the Canadian identity and its culture. [444]

### Symbols

Themes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of
Canadian symbolism. [446] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and
the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols. [447] The use of the maple leaf as a
Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and
previous flags and on the Arms of Canada. [448] Canada's official tartan, known as the "maple leaf tartan",
has four colours that reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons—green in the



-----


spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after
falling. [449] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of
the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements
replacing or added to those derived from the British version. [450]

_The mother beaver_ on the
Canadian parliament's Peace

Other prominent symbols include the national motto, " _[A mari usque ad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_mari_usque_ad_mare)_
_[mare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_mari_usque_ad_mare)_ " ("From Sea to Sea"), [451] the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse,
the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies, [448] and, more
recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk. [452] Canadian beer, maple syrup,
tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts, and poutine are defined as
uniquely Canadian. [452][453] Canadian coins feature many of these
symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢
piece, and the beaver on the nickel. [454] An image of the previous
monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, appears on $20 bank notes and the
obverse of all current Canadian coins. [454]

### Literature

Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the
literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. [455] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel
and exploration. [456] This progressed into three major themes that can be found within historical Canadian
literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison
[mentality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison_mentality) [457] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from
around the world. [458] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. [459]

Numerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards, [460] including novelist, poet,
and literary critic Margaret Atwood, who received two Booker Prizes; [461] Nobel laureate Alice Munro,
who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; [462] and Booker Prize recipient
Michael Ondaatje, who wrote the novel _[The English Patient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English_Patient)_ , which was adapted as a film of the same name
that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. [463] L. M. Montgomery produced a series of children's
novels beginning in 1908 with _[Anne of Green Gables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables)_ . [464]

### Media

Canada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and
very regionalized. [465][466] The _[Broadcasting Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_Act_(1991))_ declares "the
system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the
cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada". [467]

[A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation)

television broadcasts

Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—
particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is
often overshadowed by imports from the United States. [468] As a
result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported
by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film
Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and
[Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission) [469]



-----


Canadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a
["handful of corporations".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_ownership_in_Canada) [470] The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster,
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural
content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French. [471] In addition to the CBC,
some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as
TVOntario and Télé-Québec. [472]

Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as
well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. [473] In an effort to
reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include
both regulation of content and public financing. [474] Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in
magazine advertising. [475]

### Visual arts

Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its
Indigenous peoples, [477] and, in later times, artists have combined
British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times
embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism. [478]

The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have
taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality
of their lives in Canada. [479]

_[The Jack Pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jack_Pine)_ [by Tom Thomson.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thomson)
Oil on canvas, 1916, in the
collection of the National Gallery

[of Canada.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Canada) [476]

The Canadian government has played a role in the development of
Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by
giving grants to art galleries, [480] as well as establishing and funding
art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada
Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art
galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of
Canada's cultural works. [481]

Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of
[Seven.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven_(artists)) [482] The latter were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their
distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris,
A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating
the group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston and commercial artist Franklin Carmichael.
A. J. Casson became part of the group in 1926. [483] Associated with the group was another prominent
Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the
[Pacific Northwest Coast.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Pacific_Northwest_Coast) [484]

### Music

Canadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes. [486] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure
that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record
companies, radio stations, and television music video channels. [487] Government support programs, such as
the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and
market original and diverse Canadian music. [488] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as



-----


government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one
of the largest in the world, [489] producing internationally renowned
composers, musicians, and ensembles. [490] Music broadcasting in the
country is regulated by the CRTC. [491] [The Canadian Academy of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences)
Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the
[Juno Awards.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_Award) [492] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian
musicians for their lifetime achievements. [493]

Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years. The earliest work of
patriotic music in Canada, "The Bold Canadian", was written in 1812. [494]

Original publication of "O
Canada" in English,
1908 [485]

"The Maple Leaf Forever", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song
throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial
national anthem. [495] "O Canada" also served as an unofficial national
anthem for much of the 20th century and was adopted as the country's
official anthem in 1980. [496] Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a
setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-
Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906. [497]

### Sports

hockey team celebrates shortly after
winning the gold medal final at the

[2010 Winter Olympics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics) [498]

The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the
1770s, [499] culminating in the development and popularization of
the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, curling,
basketball, baseball, soccer, and Canadian football. [500] Canada's
official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse. [501] Other
sports such as golf, volleyball, skiing, cycling, swimming,
badminton, tennis, bowling, and the study of martial arts are all
widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels. [502] Great
achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports
[Hall of Fame.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%27s_Sports_Hall_of_Fame) [503] There are numerous other sport "halls of fame"
in Canada, such as the Hockey Hall of Fame. [503]

Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the
United States. [504] Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey
League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and
the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional competitions include the Canadian Football
League, National Lacrosse League, the Canadian Premier League, and the various curling tournaments
sanctioned and organized by Curling Canada. [505]

Canada has enjoyed success both at the Winter Olympics and at the Summer Olympics [506] —though,
particularly, the Winter Games as a "winter sports nation"—and has hosted several high-profile international
sporting events such as the 1976 Summer Olympics, [507] [the 1988 Winter Olympics,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Winter_Olympics) [508] [the 2010 Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics)

Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto. [512] The country is scheduled to co-
host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and the United States. [513]

for possible ancestral origin or descent. "Canadian" was included as an example on the
English questionnaire and "Canadien" as an example on the French questionnaire. [342]
"The majority of respondents to this selection are from the eastern part of the country that
was first settled. Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and
Francophones) and no longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response
is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage." [343][344]

Visible minorities are defined by Statistics Canada as "persons, other than aboriginal
