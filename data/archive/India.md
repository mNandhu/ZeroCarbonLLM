**India** , officially the **Republic of India** (ISO: _Bhārat_
_Ga_ ṇ _arājya_ ), [22] is a country in South Asia. It is the
seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country
as of June 2023; [23][24] and from the time of its
independence in 1947, the world's most populous
democracy. [25][26][27] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on
the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay
of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with
Pakistan to the west; [j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the
north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar [k] to the east. In the
Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the
Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a
maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

India from the northwest. [33][34] Its evidence today is
found in the hymns of the _[Rigveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda)_ . Preserved by an oral
tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the _Rigveda_ records
the dawning of Hinduism in India. [35] The Dravidian

exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, [37] and
Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social

In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and
Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and
western coasts. [44] Muslim armies from Central Asia
intermittently overran India's northern plains, [45] eventually
founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India
into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. [46] In
the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-
lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. [47] In the
Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised
religion. [48] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two
centuries of relative peace, [49] leaving a legacy of
luminous architecture. [m][50] Gradually expanding rule of
the British East India Company followed, turning India
into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its
[sovereignty.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) [51] British Crown rule began in 1858. The
rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, [52][53] but
technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas
of education and the public life took root. [54] A pioneering
and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was
noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major
factor in ending British rule. [55][56] In 1947 the British
Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent
[dominions,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion#India,_Pakistan_and_Bangladesh) [57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority Dominion of
India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid
large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration. [61]

India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed
through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's
population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost
1.4 billion in 2022. [62] During the same time, its nominal
per capita income increased from US$64 annually to
US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From
being a comparatively destitute country in 1951, [63] India
has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for
information technology services, with an expanding middle
class. [64] India has a space programme with several
planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian
movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing
role in global culture. [65] India has substantially reduced its
rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic
inequality. [66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks
high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir
with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since
the mid-20th century. [67] Among the socio-economic
challenges India faces are gender inequality, child
[malnutrition,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition_in_India) [68] and rising levels of air pollution. [69]

### Ancient India

About 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or
_[Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)_ , had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier
evolved. [28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
ago. [28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan,
[Pakistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan) [84] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, [85][84] the first urban culture in



-----


South Asia, [86] which flourished during 2500–1900  BCE in
modern day Pakistan and western India. [87] Centred around cities
such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and
relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged
robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade. [86] Ancient
India was one of the four Old World cradles of civilization. [88]

c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE [83]

During the period 2000–500  BCE, many regions of the
subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron
Age ones. [89] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with
[Hinduism,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism) [90] were composed during this period, [91] and historians
have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region
and the upper Gangetic Plain. [89] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several
waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. [90] The caste system, which
created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by
labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period. [92] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological
evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. [89] In South
India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from
this period, [93] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions. [93]

[Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajanta_Caves)

In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small
states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western
regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies
that were known as the _[mahajanapadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahajanapadas)_ . [94][95] The emerging
urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of
which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence
during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. [96] Buddhism, based on
the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all
social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the
Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in
India. [97][98][99] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both
religions held up renunciation as an ideal, [100] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions.
Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to
emerge as the Mauryan Empire. [101] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the
subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large
autonomous areas. [102][103] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and
determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of
the Buddhist _[dhamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_(Buddhism))_ . [104][105]

The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern
peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the
Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia. [106][107] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal
control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. [108][101] By the 4th and 5th
centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater
Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms. [109][110] Under the Guptas, a
renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself. [111] This



-----


renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban
elite. [110] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and
mathematics made significant advances. [110]

### Medieval India

The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to
1200  CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and
cultural diversity. [112] When Harsha of Kannauj,
who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606
to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was
defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. [113]

When his successor attempted to expand eastwards,
he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. [113]

When the Chalukyas attempted to expand

southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from
farther south, who in turn were opposed by the
Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. [113]

[Iltutmish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iltutmish)

No ruler of this period was able to create an empire
and consistently control lands much beyond their
core region. [112] During this time, pastoral peoples,
whose land had been cleared to make way for the

growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling
classes. [114] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences. [114]

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language. [115] They were
imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern
[languages of the subcontinent.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India) [115] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew
citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. [116] Temple towns of
various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. [116] By the 8th and 9th
centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were
exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. [117] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved
in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries
and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages. [117]

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast
armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading
eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. [118] The sultanate was to control
much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian
elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. [119][120]

By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation
visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned
men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic
Indo-Islamic culture in the north. [121][122] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms



-----


of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. [123] Embracing a strong Shaivite
tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of
peninsular India, [124] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards. [123]

### Early modern India

In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, [125] fell again to the superior
mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. [126] The resulting Mughal Empire
did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new
administrative practices [127][128] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, [129] leading to more systematic,
centralised, and uniform rule. [130] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the
Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an
emperor who had near-divine status. [129] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues
from agriculture [131] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, [132] caused
peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. [130] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much
of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, [130] resulting in greater patronage of
painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. [133] Newly coherent social groups in northern and
western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions
during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military
experience. [134] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political
elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. [134] As the empire disintegrated, many among these
elites were able to seek and control their own affairs. [135]

By the early 18th century, with the lines
between commercial and political dominance
being increasingly blurred, a number of
European trading companies, including the
English East India Company, had established
coastal outposts. [136][137] The East India

and technology led it to increasingly assert its
military strength and caused it to become
attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control
over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. [138][136][139][140] Its further
access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex
or subdue most of India by the 1820s. [141] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it
long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to
be the onset of India's colonial period. [136] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the
British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India
Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and
culture. [142]

### Modern India



-----


Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment
in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes
essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the
surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them,
railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in
[Europe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) [143][144][145][146] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off
the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style
social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion
rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. [147][148]

Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the
direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but
limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a
feudal safeguard against future unrest. [149][150] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all
over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885. [151][152][153][154]

The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was
marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away
markets. [155] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, [156] and, despite the risks of
infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for
Indians. [157] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled
Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. [158] The railway network provided
critical famine relief, [159] notably reduced the cost of moving goods, [159] and helped nascent Indian-owned
industry. [158]

After World War I, in which approximately
[one million Indians served,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army_during_World_War_I) [160] a new period
began. It was marked by British reforms but
also repressive legislation, by more strident
Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings
of a nonviolent movement of non-co-
operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would
become the leader and enduring symbol. [161]

During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was
enacted by the British; the Indian National
Congress won victories in the resulting

elections. [162] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's
final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of
independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan. [163]

Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in
place a secular and democratic republic. [164] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of
the Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it. [165] Economic liberalisation, which began in the
1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how, [166] has created a large urban
middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies, [167] and increased its
geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban; [168] by
religious and caste-related violence; [169] [by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite) [170] and by separatism
in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India. [171] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China [172]

and with Pakistan. [172] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations;
however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population
remains a goal yet to be achieved. [173]

## Geography

India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the
[Indo-Australian Plate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Australian_Plate) [174] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the
Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by
seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. [174] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan
oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate. [174] These dual processes, driven
by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust
eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas. [174] Immediately south of the emerging
Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne
sediment [175] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain. [176] The original Indian plate makes its first
appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a
southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the
Aravallis. [177][178][179]

The Tungabhadra, with rocky
outcrops, flows into the peninsular

[Krishna river.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_river) [180]

The remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest
and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as
the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel
chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the
coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east. [181] To the
south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is
flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western
[and Eastern Ghats;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ghats) [182] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock
formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such
fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35°
30′ north latitude [n] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude. [183]

India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of
this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India
and 2,094 kilometres (1,300  mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and
Lakshadweep island chains. [184] According to the Indian naval
hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following:
43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46%
mudflats or marshy shores. [184]

Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the
Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. [185] Important tributaries of the Ganges include
the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to
severe floods and course changes. [186][187] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their
waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain
into the Bay of Bengal; [188] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. [189] Coastal
features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern



-----


India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. [190] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls
off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman
[Sea.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_Sea) [191]

Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the
economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. [192] The Himalayas prevent cold Central
Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most
locations at similar latitudes. [193][194] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden
south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's
rainfall. [192] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical
humid, and montane. [195]

Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018. [196] [Climate change in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_India)
is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the
major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. [197] According to some current
projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the
present century. [198]

## Biodiversity

India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity
and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them. [199] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all
mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish
species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. [200][201] Fully a third of Indian plant species are
endemic. [202] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, [70] or regions that display
significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism. [o][203]

According to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789 km 2 (275,595 sq mi), which is 21.71% of the
country's total land area. [71] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of _canopy density_ , or the
proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy. [204]  _Very dense forest_ , whose _canopy density_ is
greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area. [204][205] It predominates in the tropical moist forest
of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India. _Moderately dense forest_ , whose canopy
density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area. [204][205] It predominates in the
temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous _[sal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorea_robusta)_ forest of eastern India, and the dry
deciduous teak forest of central and southern India. [206]  _Open forest_ , whose canopy density is between 10%
and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area. [204][205] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in
the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-
Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible. [207]

Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent _[Azadirachta indica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azadirachta_indica)_ , or _neem_ ,
which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine, [208] and the luxuriant _[Ficus religiosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_religiosa)_ , or _peepul_ , [209]

which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro, [210] and under which the Buddha is recorded in
the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment. [211]

Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which
India separated more than 100 million years ago. [212] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a
mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many
endemic Indian forms. [213] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical



-----


passes flanking the Himalayas. [214] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals,
which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians. [201] Among
endemics are the vulnerable [215] [hooded leaf monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgiri_Langur) [216] and the threatened [217] [Beddome's toad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duttaphrynus_beddomii) [217][218]

of the Western Ghats.

India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms. [219] These
include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the
gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become
nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle. [220] Before they were extensively
used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals
with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the
blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct. [221]

The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically
endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in
1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act [222] and Project Tiger
to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in
1988. [223] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen  biosphere reserves, [224]

four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered
under the Ramsar Convention. [225]

## Politics and government

### Politics

A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system, [228] India has six recognised national parties, including
the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50  regional
[parties.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_India#State_parties) [229] The Congress is considered centre in Indian political culture, [230] and the BJP right-
[wing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics) [231][232][233] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the



-----


late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since
then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the
BJP, [234] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often
forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the
centre. [235] India was 2023 the 19th most electoral democratic
country in Asia according to the V-Dem Democracy indices . [236]

In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957,
and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy
victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly
became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected
death in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to
lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following

public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in
1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted
just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh.
Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was
assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections
later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly
formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively
short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and
[Chandra Shekhar.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_Shekhar) [237] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The
Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha
[Rao.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Narasimha_Rao) [238]

A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election
of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The
BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two
comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended
on external support. There were two prime ministers during this
period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was
able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance
(NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-
Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term. [239]

Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute
majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party,
forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance
(UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who
opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it
no longer required external support from India's communist parties. [240] That year, Manmohan Singh
became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive
five-year term. [241] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a
majority and govern without the support of other parties. [242] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was



-----


victorious again. The incumbent prime minister is Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat. On 22
July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was elected India's 15th president and took the oath of office on 25 July
2022. [243]

### Government

India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the
Constitution of India—the country's supreme legal document. It is a
constitutional republic.

Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official
residence of the President of India,
was designed by British architects
Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker
for the Viceroy of India, and
constructed between 1911 and

Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union
and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on
26 January 1950, [245] originally stated India to be a "sovereign,
democratic republic;" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to
"a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic". [246] India's
form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a
strong centre and weak states, [247] has grown increasingly federal
since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social
changes. [248][249]

Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head
[of state,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state) [254] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term
by an electoral college comprising members of national
and state legislatures. [255][256] [The Prime Minister of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India)
India is the head of government and exercises most
[executive power.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)) [257] Appointed by the president, [258]
the prime minister is by convention supported by the
party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the
lower house of parliament. [257] The executive of the
Indian government consists of the president, the vice-
president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the
cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the
prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a
member of one of the houses of parliament. [254] In the
Indian parliamentary system, the executive is
subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and
their council are directly responsible to the lower house
of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent
executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them. [259]

Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a
Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya
Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the
People). [260] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered
six-year terms. [261] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in
numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. [258] All but two of the
Lok Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-



-----


member constituencies for five-year terms. [262] Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-
Indians in the article 331, have been scrapped. [263][264]

Judiciary: India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary [265] comprising the supreme
court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial
courts. [265] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental
rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over
the high courts. [266] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which
contravene the constitution [267] and invalidate any government action it deems
unconstitutional. [268]

### Administrative divisions

India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories. [14] All states, as well as the union
territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected
legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union
territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the
States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. [269] There are over a quarter of a
million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels. [270]

### Foreign and strategic relations

In the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and
Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement. [272]

During the 1950s and 60s, India
played a pivotal role in the Non-

[Aligned Movement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement) [271] From left
to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of
United Arab Republic (now Egypt),
Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and
Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade,
September 1961.

After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went
to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been
humiliated. [273] This was followed by another military conflict in
1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack. [274] India
has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations
have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three
of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir,
while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the
[independence of Bangladesh.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War) [275] In the late 1980s, the Indian
military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country:
a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and
an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in the
Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue
close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late
1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier. [276]

Aside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia, [277] India
has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent
years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. In May
2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South
Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC
countries. [278] It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and
other multilateral forums. [279] 2023 G20 summit was held in
India. [280] India has close economic ties with countries in South
[America,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America) [281] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a "Look East" policy that
seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and
South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and
regional security. [282][283]

Since the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with
the United States and the European Union. [284] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between
India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and
the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a
consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. [285] India subsequently signed co-
operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, [286] France, [287] the United
[Kingdom,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations) [288] and Canada. [289]

### Military

The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's
armed forces; with 1.45  million active troops, they compose the
world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the
Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard. [291]

was the foreign guest was led by
India's oldest regiment, the
Maratha Light Infantry, founded in
1768. [290]

The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion,
or 1.83% of GDP. [292] Defence expenditure was pegged at
US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than
previous fiscal year. [293][294] India is the world's second-largest arms
importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total
global arms imports. [295] Much of the military expenditure was
focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing
Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean. [296] In October 2018, India
signed a US$5.43 billion (over [₹](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee) 400 billion) agreement with Russia
to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems,
Russia's most advanced long-range missile defence system. [297] The

nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations
across four continents.

China's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965
war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons. [298] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in
1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India
has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. [299] India maintains a "no first use" nuclear policy and is
developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its "Minimum Credible Deterrence" doctrine. [300][301] It is
developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet. [302][303] Other indigenous
military projects involve the design and implementation of _[Vikrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikrant_class_aircraft_carrier)_ [-class aircraft carriers and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikrant_class_aircraft_carrier) _[Arihant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arihant_class_submarine)_ [-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arihant_class_submarine)

## Economy

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth
$3.46 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, around $11.6 trillion, the
third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). [308] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over
the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, [309] India is one of the world's fastest-growing
[economies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate) [310] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in
[GDP per capita at PPP.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) [311] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were



-----


influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention
and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside
world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the
nation to liberalise its economy; [312] since then, it has moved
increasingly towards a free-market system [313][314] by emphasising
both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. [315] India has
been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January
1995. [316]

India is the world's largest producer
of milk, with the largest population of
cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's
milk was sourced from small farms
with herd size between one and two,
the milk harvested by hand
milking. [307]

The 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second-
largest, as of 2017. [291] The service sector makes up 55.6% of
GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%.
India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100  billion in
2022, [317] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by
32 million Indians working in foreign countries. [318] Major
agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea,
sugarcane, and potatoes. [14] Major industries include textiles,
telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology,
food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining,
petroleum, machinery, and software. [14] In 2006, the share of
external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in
1985. [313] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.7%; [319] In
2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the
[sixteenth-largest exporter.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports) [320] Major exports include petroleum
products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods,
chemicals, and manufactured leather goods. [14] Major imports
include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals. [14]

Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and
engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%. [321]

India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in
the 2013 calendar year. [322]

Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior
to 2007, [313] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates
during the first decade of the 21st century. [323] Some 431 million
Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are
projected to number around 580  million by 2030. [324] Though
ranking 68th in global competitiveness, [325] as of 2010, India ranks
17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector,
44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies. [326] With
seven of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009, the
country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States. [327] India
is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023. [328] As of 2023, India's consumer market was the
world's fifth-largest. [329]

Driven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when
economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It is expected to
grow to US$2,466 by 2022. [18] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing
countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in
the near future.

A panorama of Bangalore, the centre of India's software development economy. In
the 1980s, when the first multinational corporations began to set up centres in
India, they chose Bangalore because of the large pool of skilled graduates in the
area, in turn due to the many science and engineering colleges in the surrounding

region. [330]

According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could
overtake that of the United States by 2045. [331] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to
grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until
2050. [331] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population;
growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained
growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class. [331] The World Bank cautions
that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport
infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security,
and public health and nutrition. [332]

According to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report 2017 released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
which was created by comparing more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of
the cheapest cities were in India: Bangalore (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th). [333]

### Industries

India's telecommunication industry is the second-largest in the world
with over 1.2  billion subscribers. It contributes 6.5% to India's
GDP. [334] After the third quarter of 2017, India surpassed the US to
become the second-largest smartphone market in the world after
China. [335]

The Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing,
increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010, [336] and
exports by 36% during 2008–2009. [337] In 2022, India became the
world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United
States, surpassing Japan. [338] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT
industry employed 2.8  million professionals, generated revenues
close to US$100  billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and
contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports. [339]



-----


The pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical
companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer,
largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50–60% of global vaccines demand, these all
contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to
US$42 billion. [340][341] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world. [342][343] The Indian
biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹ 204.4 billion (Indian rupees)
to ₹ 235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates). [344]

### Energy

India's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable. [345] [The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_in_India)
country's usage of coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is
competing strongly. [346] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about
2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average. [347][348] Increasing access
to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India. [349]

### Socio-economic challenges

Despite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to
face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest
number of people living below the World Bank's international
poverty line of US$1.25 per day. [351] The proportion decreased from
60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. [352] Under the World Bank's later
revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011. [q][354] 30.7% of India's
children under the age of five are underweight. [355] According to a
Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the
population is undernourished. [356][357] [The Midday Meal Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midday_Meal_Scheme)
attempts to lower these rates. [358]

A 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million
people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such
as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced
begging, among others. [359] According to the 2011 census, there
were 10.1  million child labourers in the country, a decline of
2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001. [360]

Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state
domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. [361] [Corruption in India is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India)
perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180
countries in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in 2014. [362][363]

Epidemic and pandemic diseases have long been a major factor, including COVID-19 and cholera. [364]

## Demographics, languages and religion



-----


**India by language**

With 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census
[report,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Census_of_India) [365] India was the world's second-most populous country. [r] Its
population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011, [367] compared to 21.54%
growth in the previous decade (1991–2001). [367] The human sex ratio,
according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. [365] The
median age was 28.7 as of 2020. [291] The first post-colonial census,
conducted in 1951, counted 361  million people. [368] Medical advances
made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity
brought about by the "Green Revolution" have caused India's population to
grow rapidly. [369]

The life expectancy in India is 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years
for men. [291] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people. [370]

Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in
India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by
31.2% between 1991 and 2001. [371] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas. [372][373] The level of
urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing
down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas
since 1991. [374] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India;
among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing
order by population. [375] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among
males. [376] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1
percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas. [374]

Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%. [376]

There are several hundred languages of India. About 74% of Indians
speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-
European languages; 24% speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to
South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan
languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan
languages. India has no national language. [377] Hindi, with the
largest number of speakers, is the official language of the
government. [378][379] English is used extensively in business and
administration and has the status of a "subsidiary official
language"; [6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of
higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more
official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22
"scheduled languages".

The 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest

number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining
were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others [s] (0.9%). [13]

India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country. [380][381]

## Culture



-----


Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. [382] During the
Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu
philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many
beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as _[dhárma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma)_ , _[kárma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma)_ ,
_[yóga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga)_ , and _[mok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha)_ [ṣ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha) _[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha)_ , were established. [75] India is notable for its
religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam,
Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. [383] The
predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various
historical schools of thought, including those of the _[Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads)_ , [384]

[philosophy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy) [385]

### Visual art

Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th
century

India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many
influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first
millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to
Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by
Hindu art. [386] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley
Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually
carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The
"Pashupati" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–
29, is the best known. [387][388] After this there is a long period with
virtually nothing surviving. [388][389] Almost all surviving ancient
Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in
durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more
in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first
imperial movement. [390][391][392] In the first millennium CE,
Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and
Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art. [393]

Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting
the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise

anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing _prana_ ("breath" or
life-force). [394][395] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or
represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and
[Parvati.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati) [396][397]

Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi,
Sarnath and Amaravati, [398] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain
sites appear rather later. [399][400] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the
prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors
probably usually served all communities. [401] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded
as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu
sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves. [402][403] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after
c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues. [404] But in the South, under the
Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great
achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India. [405][406]



-----


Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the
crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most
important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned
as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times. [407][408] Painted
manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the
10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later
Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings. [409]

The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the
Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular
painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of
princely pleasures and wars. [410][411] The style spread to Hindu
courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of
styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and
[Nainsukh.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nainsukh) [412][413] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company
painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence. [414][415] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat
paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the
Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern
[Indian painting.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Indian_painting) [416][417]

### Architecture

architectural balance

Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other
works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian
architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported
styles. [418] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its
flavours. _[Vastu shastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vastu_shastra)_ , literally "science of construction" or
"architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan, [419] explores
how the laws of nature affect human dwellings; [420] it employs
precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived
cosmic constructs. [421] As applied in Hindu temple architecture,
it is influenced by the _[Shilpa Shastras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shastras)_ , a series of foundational
texts whose basic mythological form is the _Vastu-Purusha_
_mandala_ , a square that embodied the "absolute". [422] The Taj
Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of
Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been
described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel of

Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". [423] [Indo-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Saracenic_Revival_architecture)
Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic
[architecture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Islamic_architecture) [424]

### Literature

The earliest literature in India, composed between 1500  BCE and 1200  CE, was in the Sanskrit
language. [425] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the _[Rigveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda)_ (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the
[epics:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_epic_poetry) _[Mahābhārata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata)_ (c. 400  BCE  – c. 400  CE) and the _[Ramayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana)_ (c. 300  BCE and later);
_Abhijñānaśākuntalam_ ( _[The Recognition of Śakuntalā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Recognition_of_%C5%9Aakuntal%C4%81)_ ), and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c. 5th century CE)
and _[Mahākāvya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_Classical_poetry)_ poetry. [426][427][428] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE)



-----


consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work. [429][430][431][432] From the 14th to
the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the
emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a
varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works
differed significantly from classical traditions. [433] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in
social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the
works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore, [434] who was a recipient of the

### Performing arts and media

Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical
music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the
northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools. [435] Regionalised
popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the
_[bauls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baul)_ is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse
folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: _[bhangra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra_(dance))_
of Punjab, _[bihu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihu_dance)_ of Assam, _[Jhumair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhumair)_ and _[chhau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhau_dance)_ of Jharkhand, Odisha and
West Bengal, _[garba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garba_(dance))_ and _[dandiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandiya_Raas)_ of Gujarat, _[ghoomar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoomar)_ of Rajasthan, and
_[lavani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavani)_ of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and
mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's
[National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangeet_Natak_Akademi)
_[bharatanatyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Natyam)_ of the state of Tamil Nadu, _[kathak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathak)_ of Uttar Pradesh,
_[kathakali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathakali)_ and _[mohiniyattam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohiniyattam)_ of Kerala, _[kuchipudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchipudi)_ of Andhra Pradesh,
_[manipuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipuri_dance)_ of Manipur, _[odissi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odissi)_ of Odisha, and the _[sattriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sattriya)_ of Assam. [436]

[India's National Academy of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangeet_Natak_Akademi)
[Performance Arts has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangeet_Natak_Akademi)
recognised eight Indian
dance styles to be
_classical_ . One such is
Kuchipudi shown here.

Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written
dialogue. [437] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from
medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes:
the _[bhavai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavai)_ of Gujarat, the _[jatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatra_(Bengal))_ of West Bengal, the _[nautanki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautanki)_ and _[ramlila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramlila)_ of
North India, _[tamasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamasha)_ of Maharashtra, _[burrakatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrakatha)_ of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, _[terukkuttu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terukkuttu)_ of Tamil
Nadu, and the _[yakshagana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakshagana)_ of Karnataka. [438] India hosts the National School of Drama (NSD), a premier
theatre training institute located in New Delhi. It is an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of
Culture, Government of India. [439] The Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched
cinema. [440] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi,
Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages. [441] The Hindi
language film industry ( _Bollywood_ ) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed
by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined. [442]

Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded
slowly for more than two decades. [443][444] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s.
Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society. [445] Today,



-----


television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over
554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass
media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million). [446]

### Society

Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy.
The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification
and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent.
Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary
groups, often termed as _[jātis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%81ti)_ , or "castes". [447] India abolished
untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has
since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare
initiatives.

Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-
generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India,

though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. [448] An overwhelming majority of Indians,
with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. [449] Marriage is
thought to be for life, [449] and the divorce rate is extremely low, [450] with less than one in a thousand
marriages ending in divorce. [451] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed
before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. [452] Female infanticide in India, and lately female
foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from
15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the
same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female electorate. [453] According to an Indian
government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care. [454]

Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result
of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society. [455] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains
widespread across class lines. [456] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise,
despite stringent anti-dowry laws. [457]

Many Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai
Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi. [458][459]

### Education

In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This
compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27%
and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%, [460][461] According to
Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more
caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity
limited its growth. [462]

The education system of India is the world's second-largest. [463] India has over 900 universities, 40,000
colleges [464] and 1.5 million schools. [465] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats
are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's



-----


improved education system is often cited as one of the main
contributors to its economic development. [466][467]

leader B. R. Ambedkar.

From ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely
worn traditional dress in India was draped. [468] For women it took
the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long. [468] The
sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the
shoulder. [468] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt,
or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure
fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli,
which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—
passing over the shoulder—serving to cover the midriff and obscure
the upper body's contours. [468] For men, a similar but shorter length
of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body
garment. [469]

and sweater, and pink
[shalwar kameez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez)

The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was
established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c. 1300 CE) and then continued
by the Mughal Empire (c. 1525 CE). [470] Among the garments introduced
during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas,
both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez. [470] In southern
India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous
use. [470]

Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring,
which causes them to become pleated around the waist. [471] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can
be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at
the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt
or tunic, [472] its side seams left open below the waist-line. [473] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made
of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either
just above or just below the wearer's knees. [474]

In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the
sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions. [475] The
traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans. [475] In



-----


white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round. [475]

For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short
Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars. [475] The
dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven
khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions, [476] is seldom seen in the cities. [475]

### Cuisine

South Indian vegetarian
thali, or platter

The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain
fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes. [477] The cooked
cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from
wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry; [478] the idli,
a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and
made from a batter of rice- and gram meal. [479] The savoury dishes might
include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and
garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander,
cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others as informed by culinary
conventions. [477] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In
some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of
cooking. [480]

[Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha)

A platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the
cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments,
which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments
are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is
accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—
such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils. [477]

India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its
adherents. [481] The appearance of _[ahimsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa)_ , or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many
religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought
to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu
population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as
among Jains. [481] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the
overall diet is low. [482] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in
its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy,
rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption. [483]

The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the
Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf, [484] developed in the Abbasid caliphate, [485] and cooking
techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its
northwest. [486] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be
added in India. [486] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed
tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today
become the Indian biryani, [486] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India. [487] In the food served in
Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of
Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally



-----


been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which
is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial
response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of India. [481]

### Sports and recreation

Several traditional indigenous sports such as _[kabaddi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaddi)_ , _[kho kho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kho_kho)_ ,
_[pehlwani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pehlwani)_ and _[gilli-danda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilli-danda)_ , and also martial arts such as
_[Kalarippayattu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalarippayattu)_ and _[marma adi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marma_adi)_ , remain popular. Chess is commonly
held to have originated in India as _[chatura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga)_ [ṅ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga) _[ga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga)_ ; [489] in recent years,
there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters. [490]

Viswanathan Anand became the Chess World Champion in 2007
and held the title until 2013. He also won the Chess World Cup in
2000 and 2002. In 2023, 18-year-old R Praggnanandhaa finished as
runner-up in the Chess World Cup 2023. [491] Parcheesi is derived
from _[Pachisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachisi)_ , another traditional Indian pastime, which in early
modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal
emperor Akbar the Great. [492] The tabletop game carrom, which
originated in India, is also very popular. [493]

Cricket is the most popular sport in India. [494] Major domestic leagues include the Indian Premier League.
Professional leagues in other sports include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi
league. [495][496][497]

India has won two Cricket
World Cups, the 1983 edition
and the 2011 edition, as well as
becoming the inaugural T20
World Cup Champions in 2007.
India has also won the

Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar about to score a record 14,000 runs in
Test cricket while playing against Australia in Bangalore, 2010

Champions Trophy twice, in
2002 and 2013. The only edition
[of the World Championship of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_of_Cricket)
Cricket was won by India in

[1985.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_World_Championship_of_Cricket_final)

India also has eight field hockey gold medals in the summer olympics. [498] The improved results garnered
by the Indian Davis Cup team and other tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly
popular in the country. [499] India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won
several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth
[Games.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games) [500][501] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton [502]

(Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are two of the top-ranked female badminton players in the world),
boxing, [503] and wrestling. [504] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the
north-eastern states. India has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An
example of this dominance is the basketball competition, where the Indian team won four out of five
tournaments to date. [505][506]

India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the
1987, 1996, 2011 and 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to host it in
2031); the 1978, 1997 and 2013 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup tournaments (and is also scheduled to
host it in 2025); the 1987, 1985 and 2016 South Asian Games; the 1990-91 Men's Asia Cup; the 2002
Chess World Cup; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Cricket Champion's Trophy (and is also
scheduled to host it in 2029); the 2006 Women's Asia Cup; the 2009 World Badminton Championships; the
2010 Hockey World Cup; the 2010 Commonwealth Games; the 2016 ICC Men's Cricket T20 World Cup
(and is also scheduled to host it in 2026); the 2016 ICC Women's Cricket T20 World Cup; and the 2017
FIFA U-17 World Cup. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Maharashtra
Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Formula 1 Indian
Grand Prix featured in late 2011 but has been discontinued from the F1 season calendar since 2014. [507]

world's new nations."

World Series (2 ed.), Wiley-Blackwell, "One of these is the idea of India as 'the world's
largest democracy', but a democracy forged less by the creation of representative institutions
and expanding electorate under British rule than by the endeavours of India's founding
fathers – Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Ambedkar – and the labours of the Constituent Assembly
between 1946 and 1949, embodied in the Indian constitution of 1950. This democratic order,
reinforced by the regular holding of nationwide elections and polling for the state
assemblies, has, it can be argued, consistently underpinned a fundamentally democratic
state structure – despite the anomaly of the Emergency and the apparent durability of the
Gandhi-Nehru dynasty."

managed with remarkable and sustained commitment to national unity and democracy."

human beings— _Homo sapiens_ —originated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between
60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian
subcontinent. It seems likely that initially they came by way of the coast. ... it is virtually
certain that there were _Homo sapiens_ in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the
earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the
present."

"Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the _Homo sapiens_ range beyond
Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as
late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations.
Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation,
spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the
warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean.
Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago."

1,028 hymns (suktas), highly crafted poetic compositions originally intended for recital during
rituals and for the invocation of and communication with the Indo-Aryan gods. Modern
scholarly opinion largely agrees that these hymns were composed between around
1500 BCE and 1200 BCE, during the eastward migration of the Indo-Aryan tribes from the
mountains of what is today northern Afghanistan across the Punjab into north India."

later on also in more eastern areas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500 BCE and ca.
500–400 BCE. The oldest text, the Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with
the Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 BCE); ... The Vedic texts were orally
composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from
teacher to student that was formalised early on. This ensured an impeccable textual
transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a _tape-_
_recording_ of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical
(tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. (pp.

"In Punjab, a dry region with grasslands watered by five rivers (hence 'panch' and 'ab')
draining the western Himalayas, one prehistoric culture left no material remains, but some of
its ritual texts were preserved orally over the millennia. The culture is called Aryan, and
evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the
Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves
sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their
ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. [Vedic Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_Sanskrit) is recorded only in hymns
that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the
elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they
seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and
Artharva)."

[4)](https://books.google.com/books?id=3TRtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14) , "Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been
due to an 'Aryan invasion' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a
few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the
subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor
of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the
north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one
then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European
language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the
gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics.
However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the
one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process
whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who
eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'—was certainly two-way. That is, it
involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably
including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would
be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the
Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are
poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact
on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.";

"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not

be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant
either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It
comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking elite, or
Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas."

Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and
incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their
domains into either Pakistan or India. ... Each new government asserted its exclusive
sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all
other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used
for its national development... Simultaneously, the central civil and military services and
judiciary split roughly along religious 'communal' lines, even as they divided movable

magnitude of refugee movements in South Asia after 1947 must be understood in the context
of pre-existing migratory flows within the partitioned regions (see also Chatterji 2013). She
also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into
trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of

'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the
subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries."

British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with
the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and
Bengal. ... Indeed for many the Indian subcontinent's division in August 1947 is seen as a
unique event which defies comparative historical and conceptual analysis"

"South Asians learned that the British Indian empire would be partitioned on 3 June 1947.
They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and,
later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million,
where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or
sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands,
did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced
relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the
creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British
empire in India"

was taken by European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, which referred to the people
who lived across the Indus River. This Arabic term was itself taken from the Persian term
Hindū, which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, Hindustan emerged as a popular
alternative name for India, meaning the "land of Hindus." "

arid zone. Probably the more humid conditions that prevail near the Aravallis prevented the
extension of aridity towards the east and the Ganges Valley. It is noteworthy that, wherever
there are gaps in this range, sand has advanced to the east of it."

Ranges on its eastern border, which consist largely of tightly folded and highly
metamorphosed Archaean rocks."

179. Fisher 2018 , p. 83, " East of the lower Indus lay the inhospitable Rann of Kutch and Thar

Desert. East of the upper Indus lay the more promising but narrow corridor between the
Himalayan foothills on the north and the Thar Desert and Aravalli Mountains on the south. At
the strategic choke point, just before reaching the fertile, well-watered Gangetic plain, sat
Delhi. On this site, where life giving streams running off the most northern spur of the rocky
Aravalli ridge flowed into the Jumna river, and where the war-horse and war-elephant trade
intersected, a series of dynasties built fortified capitals."

207. Tritsch 2001 , p. 12India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the rain shadow area of

the Deccan Plateau east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-
Gangetic plain. Growth is limited only by moisture availability in these areas, so with
irrigation the fertile alluvial soil of Punjab and Haryana has been turned into India's prime
agricultural area. Much of the thorn forest covering the plains probably had savannah-like
features now no longer visible.

221. Tritsch 2001 , p. 15Before it was so heavily settled and intensively exploited, the Punjab was

dominated by thorn forest interspersed by rolling grasslands which were grazed on by
millions of Blackbuck, accompanied by their dominant predator, the Cheetah. Always keen
hunters, the Moghul princes kept tame cheetahs which were used to chase and bring down
the Blackbuck. Today the Cheetah is extinct in India and the severely endangered Blackbuck
no longer exists in the Punjab.

Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector before unilaterally withdrawing, as if to underline
the insult; most of the war's several thousand casualties were Indian. The PLA's decisive
victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status
quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls almost all of
the disputed territory. A nationalistic press and commentariat have kept 1962 vivid in India's

territory claimed by them was undertaken in the mistaken belief that Beijing would be

proximity to India. These misjudgments would eventually culminate in India's humiliating
defeat in the war of October–November 1962."

limited to the purpose of facilitating trade through the vertiginous Nathu-la Pass, the scene of
bloody artillery duels in September 1967 when Indian troops beat back attacking Chinese

17 November 2019. "In the last 50 years of Indian democracy, the absolute number of
missing women has increased fourfold from 15 million to 68 million. This is not merely a
reflection of the growth in the overall population, but, rather, of the fact that this dangerous
trend has worsened with time. As a percentage of the female electorate, missing women
have gone up significantly — from 13 per cent to approximately 20 per cent"

"More than 63 million women are "missing" statistically across India, and more than 21
million girls are unwanted by their families, government officials say. The skewed ratio of
men to women is largely the result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and
medical care for boys, according to the government's annual economic survey, which was
released on Monday. In addition, the survey found that "families where a son is born are
more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born".

a thick batter made from coarsely ground rice and dehulled black gram. Idli cakes are soft,
moist and spongy, have desirable sour flavour, and is eaten as breakfast in South India.
Dosa batter is very similar to idli batter, except that both the rice and black gram are finely
grounded. The batter is thinner than that of idli and is fried as a thin, crisp pancake and eaten
directly in South India."

Persian and Afghan traditions of dress, 'architecture and cuisine' were adopted by non-
Muslim indigenous elites in South Asia. In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with
older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion
of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of
Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel
modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which
